<br>
<p class="first">In April, 1848, the author of the present volume
left England in company with Mr. A. R. Wallace&mdash;&ldquo;who has
since acquired wide fame in connection with the Darwinian theory of
Natural Selection&rdquo;&mdash;on a joint expedition up the river
Amazons, for the purpose of investigating the Natural History of
the vast wood-region traversed by that mighty river and its
numerous tributaries. Mr. Wallace returned to England after four
years&rsquo; stay, and was, we believe, unlucky enough to lose the
greater part of his collections by the shipwreck of the vessel in
which he had transmitted them to London. Mr. Bates prolonged his
residence in the Amazon valley seven years after Mr.
Wallace&rsquo;s departure, and did not revisit his native country
again until 1859. Mr. Bates was also more fortunate than his
companion in bringing his gathered treasures home to England in
safety. So great, indeed, was the mass of specimens accumulated by
Mr. Bates during his eleven years&rsquo; researches, that upon the
working out of his collection, which has been accomplished (or is
now in course of being accomplished) by different scientific
naturalists in this country, it has been ascertained that
representatives of no less than 14,712 <i>species</i> are amongst
them, of which about 8000 were previously unknown to science. It
may be remarked that by far the greater portion of these species,
namely, about 14,000, belong to the class of Insects&mdash;to the
study of which Mr. Bates principally devoted his
attention&mdash;being, as is well known, himself recognised as no
mean authority as regards this class of organic beings. In his
present volume, however, Mr. Bates does not confine himself to his
entomological discoveries, nor to any other branch of Natural
History, but supplies a general outline of his adventures during
his journeyings up and down the mighty river, and a variety of
information concerning every object of interest, whether physical
or political, that he met with by the way.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates landed at Par&aacute; in May, 1848. His first part is
entirely taken up with an account of the Lower Amazons&mdash;that
is, the river from its sources up to the city of Manaos or Barra do
Rio Negro, where it is joined by the large northern confluent of
that name&mdash;and with a narrative of his residence at
Par&aacute; and his various excursions in the neighbourhood of that
city. The large collection made by Mr. Bates of the animal
productions of Par&aacute; enabled him to arrive at the following
conclusions regarding the relations of the Fauna of the south side
of the Amazonian delta with those of other regions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is generally allowed that Guiana and Brazil, to the
north and south of the Par&aacute; district, form two distinct
provinces, as regards their animal and vegetable inhabitants. By
this it means that the two regions have a very large number of
forms peculiar to themselves, and which are supposed not to have
been derived from other quarters during modern geological times.
Each may be considered as a centre of distribution in the latest
process of dissemination of species over the surface of tropical
America. Par&aacute; lies midway between the two centres, each of
which has a nucleus of elevated table-land, whilst the intermediate
river-valley forms a wide extent of low-lying country. It is,
therefore, interesting to ascertain from which the latter received
its population, or whether it contains so large a number of endemic
species as would warrant the conclusion that it is itself an
independent province. To assist in deciding such questions as
these, we must compare closely the species found in the district
with those of the other contiguous regions, and endeavour to
ascertain whether they are identical, or only slightly modified, or
whether they are highly peculiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Von Martius when he visited this part of Brazil forty
years ago, coming from the south, was much struck with the
dissimilarity of the animal and vegetable productions to those of
other parts of Brazil. In fact the Fauna of Par&aacute;, and the
lower part of the Amazons has no close relationship with that of
Brazil proper; but it has a very great affinity with that of the
coast region of Guiana, from Cayenne to Demerara. If we may judge
from the results afforded by the study of certain families of
insects, no peculiar Brazilian forms are found in the Par&aacute;
district; whilst more than one-half of the total number are
essentially Guiana species, being found nowhere else but in Guiana
and Amazonia. Many of them, however, are modified from the Guiana
type, and about one-seventh seem to be restricted to Par&aacute;.
These endemic species are not highly peculiar, and they may yet be
found over a great part of Northern Brazil when the country is
better explored. They do not warrant us in concluding that the
district forms an independent province, although they show that its
Fauna is not wholly derivative, and that the land is probably not
entirely a new formation. From all these facts, I think we must
conclude that the Par&aacute; district belongs to the Guiana
province and that, if it is newer land than Guiana, it must have
received the great bulk of its animal population from that region.
I am informed by Dr. Sclater that similar results are derivable
from the comparison of the birds of these countries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the most interesting excursions made by Mr. Bates from
Par&aacute; was the ascent of the river Tocantins&mdash;the mouth
of which lies about 45 miles from the city of Par&aacute;. This was
twice attempted. On the second occasion&mdash;our author being in
company with Mr. Wallace&mdash;the travellers penetrated as far as
the rapids of Arroyos, about 130 miles from its mouth. This
district is one of the chief collecting-grounds of the well-known
Brazil-nut (<i>Bertholletia excelsa</i>), which is here very
plentiful, grove after grove of these splendid trees being visible,
towering above their fellows, with the &ldquo;woody fruits, large
and round as cannon-balls, dotted over the branches.&rdquo; The
Hyacinthine Macaw (<i>Ara hyacinthina</i>) is another natural
wonder, first met with here. This splendid bird, which is
occasionally brought alive to the Zoological Gardens of Europe,
&ldquo;only occurs in the interior of Brazil, from 16&deg; S.L. to
the southern border of the Amazon valley.&rdquo; Its enormous
beak&mdash;which must strike even the most unobservant with
wonder&mdash;appears to be adapted to enable it to feed on the nuts
of the Mucuja Palm (<i>Acrocomia lasiospatha</i>). &ldquo;These
nuts, which are so hard as to be difficult to break with a heavy
hammer, are crushed to a pulp by the powerful beak of this
Macaw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bates&rsquo; later part is mainly devoted to his residence
at Santarem, at the junction of the Rio Tapajos with the main
stream, and to his account of Upper Amazon, or Solimoens&mdash;the
Fauna of which is, as we shall presently see, in many respects very
different from that of the lower part of the river. At
Santarem&mdash;&ldquo;the most important and most civilised
settlement on the Amazon, between the Atlantic and
Par&aacute;&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Bates made his headquarters for three
years and a half, during which time several excursions up the
little-known Tapajos were effected. Some 70 miles up the stream, on
its affluent, the Cupar&iacute;, a new Fauna, for the most part
very distinct from that of the lower part of the same stream, was
entered upon. &ldquo;At the same time a considerable proportion of
the Cupar&iacute; species were identical with those of Ega, on the
Upper Amazon, a district eight times further removed than the
village just mentioned.&rdquo; Mr. Bates was more successful here
than on his excursion up the Tocantins, and obtained twenty new
species of fishes, and many new and conspicuous insects, apparently
peculiar to this part of the Amazonian valley.</p>

<p>In a later chapter Mr. Bates commences his account of the
Solimoens, or Upper Amazons, on the banks of which he passed four
years and a half. The country is a &ldquo;magnificent wilderness,
where civilised man has, as yet, scarcely obtained a
footing&mdash;the cultivated ground, from the Rio Negro to the
Andes, amounting only to a few score acres.&rdquo; During the whole
of this time Mr. Bates&rsquo; headquarters were at Ega, on the
Teff&eacute;, a confluent of the great river from the south, whence
excursions were made sometimes for 300 or 400 miles into the
interior. In the intervals Mr. Bates followed his pursuit as a
collecting naturalist in the same &ldquo;peaceful, regular
way,&rdquo; as he might have done in a European village. Our author
draws a most striking picture of the quiet, secluded life he led in
this far-distant spot. The difficulty of getting news and the want
of intellectual society were the great drawbacks&mdash;&ldquo;the
latter increasing until it became almost insupportable.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I was obliged at last,&rdquo; Mr. Bates naively remarks,
&ldquo;to come to the conclusion that the contemplation of Nature,
alone is not sufficient to fill the human heart and mind.&rdquo;
Mr. Bates must indeed have been driven to great straits as regards
his mental food, when, as he tell us, he took to reading the <i>
Athen&aelig;um</i> three times over, &ldquo;the first time
devouring the more interesting articles&mdash;the second, the whole
of the remainder&mdash;and the third, reading all the
advertisements from beginning to end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ega was, indeed, as Mr. Bates remarks, a fine field for a
Natural History collector, the only previous scientific visitants
to that region having been the German Naturalists, Spix and
Martius, and the Count de Castelnau when he descended the Amazons
from the Pacific. Mr. Bates&rsquo; account of the monkeys of the
genera <i>Brachyurus, Nyctipithecus</i> and <i>Midas</i> met with
in this region, and the whole of the very pregnant remarks which
follow on the American forms of the Quadrumana, will be read with
interest by every one, particularly by those who pay attention to
the important subject of geographical distribution. We need hardly
say that Mr. Bates, after the attention he has bestowed upon this
question, is a zealous advocate of the hypothesis of the origin of
species by derivation from a common stock. After giving an outline
of the general distribution of Monkeys, he clearly argues that
unless the &ldquo;common origin at least of the species of a family
be admitted, the problem of their distribution must remain an
inexplicable mystery.&rdquo; Mr. Bates evidently thoroughly
understands the nature of this interesting problem, and in another
passage, in which the very singular distribution of the Butterflies
of the genus <i>Heliconius</i> is enlarged upon, concludes with the
following significant remarks upon this important
subject:&mdash;</p>

<p class="quote">&ldquo;In the controversy which is being waged
amongst Naturalists since the publication of the Darwinian theory
of the origin of species, it has been rightly said that no proof at
present existed of the production of a physiological species, that
is, a form which will not interbreed with the one from which it was
derived, although given ample opportunities of doing so, and does
not exhibit signs of reverting to its parent form when placed under
the same conditions with it. Morphological species, that is, forms
which differ to an amount that would justify their being considered
good species, have been produced in plenty through selection by man
out of variations arising under domestication or cultivation. The
facts just given are therefore of some scientific importance, for
they tend to show that a physiological species can be and is
produced in nature out of the varieties of a pre-existing closely
allied one. This is not an isolated case, for I observed in the
course of my travels a number of similar instances. But in very few
has it happened that the species which clearly appears to be the
parent, co-exists with one that has been evidently derived from it.
Generally the supposed parent also seems to have been modified, and
then the demonstration is not so clear, for some of the links in
the chain of variation are wanting. The process of origination of a
species in nature as it takes place successively, must be ever,
perhaps, beyond man&rsquo;s power to trace, on account of the great
lapse of time it requires. But we can obtain a fair view of it by
tracing a variable and far-spreading species over the wide area of
its present distribution; and a long observation of such will lead
to the conclusion that new species must in all cases have arisen
out of variable and widely-disseminated forms. It sometimes
happens, as in the present instance, that we find in one locality a
species under a certain form which is constant to all the
individuals concerned; in another exhibiting numerous varieties;
and in a third presenting itself as a constant form quite distinct
from the one we set out with. If we meet with any two of these
modifications living side by side, and maintaining their
distinctive characters under such circumstances, the proof of the
natural origination of a species is complete; it could not be much
more so were we able to watch the process step by step. It might be
objected that the difference between our two species is but slight,
and that by classing them as varieties nothing further would be
proved by them. But the differences between them are such as obtain
between allied species generally. Large genera are composed in
great part of such species, and it is interesting to show the great
and beautiful diversity within a large genus as brought about by
the working of laws within our comprehension.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But to return to the Zoological wonders of the Upper Amazon,
birds, insects, and butterflies are all spoken of by Mr. Bates in
his chapter on the natural features of the district, and it is
evident that none of these classes of beings escaped the
observation of his watchful intelligence. The account of the
foraging ants of the genus <i>Eciton</i> is certainly marvellous,
and would, even of itself, be sufficient to stamp the recorder of
their habits as a man of no ordinary mark.</p>

<p>The last chapter of Mr. Bates&rsquo; work contains the account
of his excursions beyond Ega. Fonteboa, Tunantins&mdash;a small
semi-Indian settlement, 240 miles up the stream&mdash;and San Paulo
de Olivenca, some miles higher up, were the principal places
visited, and new acquisitions were gathered at each of these
localities. In the fourth month of Mr. Bates&rsquo; residence at
the last-named place, a severe attack of ague led to the
abandonment of the plans he had formed of proceeding to the
Peruvian towns of Pebas and Moyobamba, and &ldquo;so completing the
examination of the Natural History of the Amazonian plains up to
the foot of the Andes.&rdquo; This attack, which seemed to be the
culmination of a gradual deterioration of health, caused by eleven
years&rsquo; hard work under the tropics, induced him to return to
Ega, and finally to Par&aacute;, where he embarked, on the 2nd June
1859, for England. Naturally enough, Mr. Bates tells us he was at
first a little dismayed at leaving the equator, &ldquo;where the
well-balanced forces of Nature maintain a land-surface and a
climate typical of mind, and order and beauty,&rdquo; to sail
towards the &ldquo;crepuscular skies&rdquo; of the cold north. But
he consoles us by adding the remark that &ldquo;three years&rsquo;
renewed experience of England&rdquo; have convinced him &ldquo;how
incomPar&aacute;bly superior is civilised life to the spiritual
sterility of half-savage existence, even if it were passed in the
Garden of Eden.&rdquo;</p>

<h4>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE TO THE EDITION OF 1864</h4>
</center>

<p class="first">Having been urged to prepare a new edition of this
work for a wider circle than that contemplated in the former one, I
have thought it advisable to condense those portions which,
treating of abstruse scientific questions, presuppose a larger
amount of Natural History knowledge than an author has a right to
expect of the general reader. The personal narrative has been left
entire, together with those descriptive details likely to interest
all classes, young and old, relating to the great river itself, and
the wonderful country through which it flows,&mdash;the luxuriant
primaeval forests that clothe almost every part of it, the climate,
productions, and inhabitants.</p>

<p>Signs are not wanting that this fertile, but scantily peopled
region will soon become, through recent efforts of the Peruvian and
Brazilian governments to make it accessible and colonise it, of far
higher importance to the nations of Northern Europe than it has
been hitherto. The full significance of the title, the
&ldquo;largest river in the world,&rdquo; which we are all taught
in our schoolboy days to apply to the Amazons, without having a
distinct idea of its magnitude, will then become apparent to the
English public. It will be new to most people, that this noble
stream has recently been navigated by steamers to a distance of
2200 geographical miles from its mouth at Par&aacute;, or double
the distance which vessels are able to reach on the Yang-tze-Kiang,
the largest river of the old world; the depth of water in the dry
season being about seven fathoms up to this terminus of navigation.
It is not, however, the length of the trunk stream, that has earned
for the Amazons the appellation of the &ldquo;Mediterranean of
South America,&rdquo; given it by the Brazilians of Par&aacute;;
but the network of by-channels and lakes, which everywhere
accompanies its course at a distance from the banks, and which adds
many thousands of miles of easy inland navigation to the total
presented by the main river and its tributaries. The Peruvians,
especially, if I may judge from letters received within the past
few weeks, seem to be stirring themselves to grasp the advantages
which the possession of the upper course of the river places within
their reach. Vessels of heavy tonnage have arrived in Par&aacute;,
from England, with materials for the formation of shipbuilding
establishments, at a point situated two thousand miles from the
mouth of the river. Peruvian steamers have navigated from the Andes
to the Atlantic, and a quantity of cotton (now exported for the
first time), the product of the rich and healthy country bordering
the Upper Amazons, has been conveyed by this means, and shipped
from Par&aacute; to Europe. The probability of general curiosity in
England being excited before long with regard to this hitherto
neglected country, will be considered, of itself, a sufficient
reason for placing an account of its natural features and present
condition within reach of all readers.</p>
