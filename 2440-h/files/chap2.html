<p class="intro">The Swampy Forests of Par&aacute; &mdash; A Portuguese
Landed Proprietor &mdash; Country House at Nazareth &mdash; Life of a
Naturalist under the Equator &mdash; The drier Virgin Forests &mdash;Magoary
&mdash; Retired Creeks &mdash; Aborigines.</p>

<br>
<p class="first">After having resided about a fortnight at Mr.
Miller&rsquo;s rocinha, we heard of another similar country-house
to be let, much better situated for our purpose, in the village of
Nazareth, a mile and a half from the city and close to the forest.
The owner was an old Portuguese gentleman named Danin, who lived at
his tile manufactory at the mouth of the Una, a small river lying
two miles below Par&aacute;. We resolved to walk to his place
through the forest, a distance of three miles, although the road
was said to be scarcely passable at this season of the year, and
the Una much more easily accessible by boat. We were glad, however,
of this early opportunity of traversing the rich swampy forest
which we had admired so much from the deck of the ship; so, about
eleven o&rsquo;clock one sunny morning, after procuring the
necessary information about the road, we set off in that direction.
This part of the forest afterwards became one of my best
hunting-grounds. I will narrate the incidents of the walk, giving
my first impressions and some remarks on the wonderful vegetation.
The forest is very similar on most of the low lands, and therefore,
one description will do for all.</p>

<p>On leaving the town we walked along a straight, suburban road
constructed above the level of the surrounding land. It had low
swampy ground on each side, built upon, however, and containing
several spacious rocinhas which were embowered in magnificent
foliage. Leaving the last of these, we arrived at a part where the
lofty forest towered up like a wall five or six yards from the edge
of the path to the height of, probably, a hundred feet. The tree
trunks were only seen partially here and there, nearly the whole
frontage from ground to summit being covered with a diversified
drapery of creeping plants, all of the most vivid shades of green;
scarcely a flower to be seen, except in some places a solitary
scarlet passion-flower set in the green mantle like a star. The low
ground on the borders between the forest wall and the road was
encumbered with a tangled mass of bushy and shrubby vegetation,
amongst which prickly mimosas were very numerous, covering the
other bushes in the same way as brambles do in England. Other dwarf
mimosas trailed along the ground close to the edge of the road,
shrinking at the slightest touch of the feet as we passed by.
Cassia trees, with their elegant pinnate foliage and conspicuous
yellow flowers, formed a great proportion of the lower trees, and
arborescent arums grew in groups around the swampy hollows. Over
the whole fluttered a larger number of brilliantly-coloured
butterflies than we had yet seen; some wholly orange or yellow
(Callidryas), others with excessively elongated wings, sailing
horizontally through the air, coloured black, and varied with blue,
red, and yellow (Heliconii). One magnificent grassy-green species
(Col&aelig;nis Dido) especially attracted our attention. Near the
ground hovered many other smaller species very similar in
appearance to those found at home, attracted by the flowers of
numerous leguminous and other shrubs. Besides butterflies, there
were few other insects except dragonflies, which were in great
numbers, similar in shape to English species, but some of them
looking conspicuously different on account of their fiery red
colours.</p>

<p>After stopping repeatedly to examine and admire, we at length
walked onward. The road then ascended slightly, and the soil and
vegetation became suddenly altered in character. The shrubs here
were grasses, low sedges and other plants, smaller in foliage than
those growing in moist grounds. The forest was second growth, low,
consisting of trees which had the general aspect of laurels and
other evergreens in our gardens at home&mdash;the leaves glossy and dark
green. Some of them were elegantly veined and hairy
(Melastom&aelig;), whilst many, scattered amongst the rest, had
smaller foliage (Myrtles), but these were not sufficient to
subtract much from the general character of the whole.</p>

<p>The sun, now, for we had loitered long on the road, was
exceedingly powerful. The day was most brilliant; the sky without a
cloud. In fact, it was one of those glorious days which announce
the commencement of the dry season. The radiation of heat from the
sandy ground was visible by the quivering motion of the air above
it. We saw or heard no mammals or birds; a few cattle belonging to
an estate down a shady lane were congregated, panting, under a
cluster of wide-spreading trees. The very soil was hot to our feet,
and we hastened onward to the shade of the forest which we could
see not far ahead. At length, on entering it, what a relief! We
found ourselves in a moderately broad pathway or alley, where the
branches of the trees crossed overhead and produced a delightful
shade. The woods were at first of recent growth, dense, and utterly
impenetrable; the ground, instead of being clothed with grass and
shrubs as in the woods of Europe, was everywhere carpeted with
Lycopodiums (fern-shaped mosses). Gradually the scene became
changed. We descended slightly from an elevated, dry, and sandy
area to a low and swampy one; a cool air breathed on our faces, and
a mouldy smell of rotting vegetation greeted us. The trees were now
taller, the underwood less dense, and we could obtain glimpses into
the wilderness on all sides. The leafy crowns of the trees,
scarcely two of which could be seen together of the same kind, were
now far away above us, in another world as it were. We could only
see at times, where there was a break above, the tracery of the
foliage against the clear blue sky. Sometimes the leaves were
palmate, or of the shape of large outstretched hands; at others,
finely cut or feathery, like the leaves of Mimos&aelig;. Below, the
tree trunks were everywhere linked together by sip&oacute;s; the
woody, flexible stems of climbing and creeping trees, whose foliage
is far away above, mingled with that of the taller independent
trees. Some were twisted in strands like cables, others had thick
stems contorted in every variety of shape, entwining snake-like
round the tree trunks, or forming gigantic loops and coils amongst
the larger branches; others, again, were of zigzag shape, or
indented like the steps of a staircase, sweeping from the ground to
a giddy height.</p>

<p>It interested me much afterwards to find that these climbing
trees do not form any particular family. There is no distinct group
of plants whose special habit is to climb, but species of many and
the most diverse families, the bulk of whose members are not
climbers, seem to have been driven by circumstances to adopt this
habit. There is even a climbing genus of palms (Desmoncus), the
species of which are called, in the Tupi language, Jacit&aacute;ra.
These have slender, thickly-spined, and flexuous stems, which twine
about the taller trees from one to the other, and grow to an
incredible length. The leaves, which have the ordinary pinnate
shape characteristic of the family, are emitted from the stems at
long intervals, instead of being collected into a dense crown, and
have at their tips a number of long recurved spines. These
structures are excellent contrivances to enable the trees to secure
themselves by in climbing, but they are a great nuisance to the
traveller, for they sometimes hang over the pathway and catch the
hat or clothes, dragging off the one or tearing the other as he
passes. The number and variety of climbing trees in the Amazons
forests are interesting, taken in connection with the fact of the
very general tendency of the animals, also, to become climbers.</p>

<img src="images/fig3.jpg" width="239" height="445" alt=
"Climbing Palm (Desmoncus)" align="left">

<p>All the Amazonian, and in fact all South American, monkeys are
climbers. There is no group answering to the baboons of the Old
World, which live on the ground. The Gallinaceous birds of the
country, the representatives of the fowls and pheasants of Asia and
Africa, are all adapted by the position of the toes to perch on
trees, and it is only on trees, at a great height, that they are to
be seen. A genus of Plantigrade Carnivora, allied to the bears
(Cercoleptes), found only in the Amazonian forests, is entirely
arboreal, and has a long flexible tail like that of certain
monkeys. Many other similar instances could be enumerated, but I
will mention only the Geodephaga, or carnivorous ground beetles, a
great proportion of whose genera and species in these forest
regions are, by the structure of their feet, fitted to live
exclusively on the branches and leaves of trees.</p>

<p>Many of the woody lianas suspended from trees are not climbers,
but the air-roots of epiphytous plants (Aroide&aelig;), which sit
on the stronger boughs of the trees above and hang down straight as
plumb-lines. Some are suspended singly, others in clusters; some
reach halfway to the ground and others touch it, striking their
rootlets into the earth. The underwood in this part of the forest
was composed partly of younger trees of the same species as their
taller neighbours, and partly of palms of many species, some of
them twenty to thirty feet in height, others small and delicate,
with stems no thicker than a finger. These latter (different kinds
of Bactris) bore small bunches of fruit, red or black, often
containing a sweet, grape-like juice.</p>

<p>Further on, the ground became more swampy and we had some
difficulty in picking our way. The wild banana (Urania Amazonica)
here began to appear, and, as it grew in masses, imparted a new
aspect to the scene. The leaves of this beautiful plant are like
broad-sword blades, eight feet in length and a foot broad; they
rise straight upwards, alternately, from the top of a stem five or
six feet high. Numerous kinds of plants with leaves similar in
shape to these but smaller clothed the ground. Amongst them were
species of Marantace&aelig;, some of which had broad glossy leaves,
with long leaf-stalks radiating from joints in a reed-like stem.
The trunks of the trees were clothed with climbing ferns, and
Pothos plants with large, fleshy, heart-shaped leaves. Bamboos and
other tall grass and reed-like plants arched over the pathway. The
appearance of this part of the forest was strange in the extreme;
description can convey no adequate idea of it. The reader who has
visited Kew may form some notion by conceiving a vegetation like
that in the great palm-house, spread over a large tract of swampy
ground, but he must fancy it mingled with large exogenous trees
similar to our oaks and elms covered with creepers and parasites,
and figure to himself the ground encumbered with fallen and rotting
trunks, branches, and leaves; the whole illuminated by a glowing
vertical sun, and reeking with moisture.</p>

<p>At length we emerged from the forest, on the banks of the Una,
near its mouth. It was here about one hundred yards wide. The
residence of Senhor Danin stood on the opposite shore; a large
building, whitewashed and red-tiled as usual, raised on wooden
piles above the humid ground. The second story was the part
occupied by the family, and along it was an open verandah, where
people, both male and female, were at work. Below were several
negroes employed carrying clay on their heads. We called out for a
boat, and one of them crossed over to fetch us. Senhor Danin
received us with the usual formal politeness of the Portuguese, he
spoke English very well, and after we had arranged our business, we
remained conversing with him on various subjects connected with the
country. Like all employers in this province, he was full of one
topic&mdash;the scarcity of hands. It appeared that he had made great
exertions to introduce white labour, but had failed, after having
brought numbers of men from Portugal and other countries under
engagement to work for him. They all left him one by one soon after
their arrival. The abundance of unoccupied land, the liberty that
exists, a state of things produced by the half-wild canoe-life of
the people, and the case with which a mere subsistence can be
obtained with moderate work, tempt even the best-disposed to quit
regular labour as soon as they can. He complained also of the
dearness of slaves, owing to the prohibition of the African
traffic, telling us that formerly a slave could be bought for 120
dollars, whereas they are now difficult to procure at 400
dollars.</p>

<p>Mr. Danin told us that he had travelled in England and the
United States, and that he had now two sons completing their
education in those countries. I afterwards met with many
enterprising persons of Mr. Danin&rsquo;s order, both Brazilians
and Portuguese; their great ambition is to make a voyage to Europe
or North America, and to send their sons to be educated there. The
land on which his establishment is built, he told us, was an
artificial embankment on the swamp; the end of the house was built
on a projecting point overlooking the river, so that a good view
was obtained, from the sitting-rooms, of the city and the shipping.
We learned there was formerly a large and flourishing cattle estate
on this spot, with an open grassy space like a park. On Sundays,
gay parties of forty or fifty persons used to come by land and
water, in carriages and gay galliotas, to spend the day with the
hospitable owner. Since the political disorders which I have
already mentioned, decay had come upon this as on most other large
establishments in the country. The cultivated grounds, and the
roads leading to them, were now entirely overgrown with dense
forest. When we were ready to depart, Senhor Danin lent a canoe and
two negroes to take us to the city, where we arrived in the evening
after a day rich in new experiences.</p>

<br>
<p>Shortly afterwards, we took possession of our new residence. The
house was a square building, consisting of four equal-sized rooms;
the tiled roof projected all round, so as to form a broad verandah,
cool and pleasant to sit and work in. The cultivated ground, which
appeared as if newly cleared from the forest, was planted with
fruit trees and small plots of coffee and mandioca. The entrance to
the grounds was by an iron-grille gateway from a grassy square,
around which were built the few houses and palm-thatched huts which
then constituted the village. The most important building was the
chapel of our Lady of Nazareth, which stood opposite our place. The
saint here enshrined was a great favourite with all orthodox
Par&aacute;enses, who attributed to her the performance of many
miracles. The image was to be seen on the altar, a handsome doll
about four feet high, wearing a silver crown and a garment of blue
silk, studded with golden stars. In and about the chapel were the
offerings that had been made to her, proofs of the miracles which
she had performed. There were models of legs, arms, breasts, and so
forth, which she had cured. But most curious of all was a
ship&rsquo;s boat, deposited here by the crew of a Portuguese
vessel which had foundered, a year or two before our arrival, in a
squall off Cayenne; part of them having been saved in the boat,
after invoking the protection of the saint here enshrined. The
annual festival in honour of our Lady of Nazareth is the greatest
of the Par&aacute; holidays; many persons come to it from the
neighbouring city of Maranham, 300 miles distant. Once the
President ordered the mail steamer to be delayed two days at
Par&aacute; for the convenience of these visitors. The popularity
of the festival is partly owing to the beautiful weather that
prevails when it takes place, namely, in the middle of the fine
season, on the ten days preceding the full moon in October or
November. Par&aacute; is then seen at its best. The weather is not
too dry, for three weeks never follow in succession without a
shower; so that all the glory of verdure and flowers can be enjoyed
with clear skies. The moonlit nights are then especially beautiful,
the atmosphere is transparently clear, and the light sea-breeze
produces an agreeable coolness.</p>

<p>We now settled ourselves for a few months&rsquo; regular work.
We had the forest on three sides of us; it was the end of the wet
season; most species of birds had finished moulting, and every day
the insects increased in number and variety. Behind the rocinha,
after several days&rsquo; exploration, I found a series of pathways
through the woods, which led to the Una road; about half way was
the house in which the celebrated travellers Spix and Martius
resided during their stay at Par&aacute;, in 1819. It was now in a
neglected condition, and the plantations were overgrown with
bushes. The paths hereabout were very productive of insects, and
being entirely under shade, were very pleasant for strolling. Close
to our doors began the main forest road. It was broad enough for
two horsemen abreast, and branched off in three directions; the
main line going to the village of Ourem, a distance of fifty miles.
This road formerly extended to Maranham, but it had been long in
disuse and was now grown up, being scarcely passable between
Par&aacute; and Ourem.</p>

<p>Our researches were made in various directions along these
paths, and every day produced us a number of new and interesting
species. Collecting, preparing our specimens, and making notes,
kept us well occupied. One day was so much like another, that a
general description of the diurnal round of incidents, including
the sequence of natural phenomena, will be sufficient to give an
idea of how days pass to naturalists under the equator.</p>

<p>We used to rise soon after dawn, when Isidoro would go down to
the city, after supplying us with a cup of coffee, to purchase the
fresh provisions for the day. The two hours before breakfast were
devoted to ornithology. At that early period of the day the sky was
invariably cloudless (the thermometer marking 72&deg; or 73&deg;
Fahr.); the heavy dew or the previous night&rsquo;s rain, which lay
on the moist foliage, becoming quickly dissipated by the glowing
sun, which rising straight out of the east, mounted rapidly towards
the zenith. All nature was fresh, new leaf and flower-buds
expanding rapidly. Some mornings a single tree would appear in
flower amidst what was the preceding evening a uniform green mass
of forest&mdash;a dome of blossom suddenly created as if by magic. The
birds were all active; from the wild-fruit trees, not far off, we
often heard the shrill yelping of the Toucans (Ramphastos
vitellinus). Small flocks of parrots flew over on most mornings, at
a great height, appearing in distinct relief against the blue sky,
always two-by-two chattering to each other, the pairs being
separated by regular intervals; their bright colours, however, were
not apparent at that height. After breakfast we devoted the hours
from 10 a.m. to 2 or 3 p.m. to entomology; the best time for
insects in the forest being a little before the greatest heat of
the day.</p>

<p>The heat increased rapidly towards two o&rsquo;clock (92&deg;
and 93&deg; Fahr.), by which time every voice of bird or mammal was
hushed; only in the trees was heard at intervals the harsh whirr of
a cicada. The leaves, which were so moist and fresh in early
morning, now become lax and drooping; the flowers shed their
petals. Our neighbours, the Indian and Mulatto inhabitants of the
open palm-thatched huts, as we returned home fatigued with our
ramble, were either asleep in their hammocks or seated on mats in
the shade, too languid even to talk. On most days in June and July
a heavy shower would fall some time in the afternoon, producing a
most welcome coolness. The approach of the rain-clouds was after a
uniform fashion very interesting to observe. First, the cool
sea-breeze, which commenced to blow about ten o&rsquo;clock, and
which had increased in force with the increasing power of the sun,
would flag and finally die away. The heat and electric tension of
the atmosphere would then become almost insupportable. Languor and
uneasiness would seize on every one, even the denizens of the
forest, betraying it by their motions. White clouds would appear in
the cast and gather into cumuli, with an increasing blackness along
their lower portions. The whole eastern horizon would become almost
suddenly black, and this would spread upwards, the sun at length
becoming obscured. Then the rush of a mighty wind is heard through
the forest, swaying the tree-tops; a vivid flash of lightning
bursts forth, then a crash of thunder, and down streams the
deluging rain. Such storms soon cease, leaving bluish-black,
motionless clouds in the sky until night. Meantime all nature is
refreshed; but heaps of flower-petals and fallen leaves are seen
under the trees. Towards evening life revives again, and the
ringing uproar is resumed from bush and tree. The following morning
the sun again rises in a cloudless sky, and so the cycle is
completed; spring, summer, and autumn, as it were, in one tropical
day. The days are more or less like this throughout the year in
this country. A little difference exists between the dry and wet
seasons; but generally, the dry season, which lasts from July to
December, is varied with showers, and the wet, from January to
June, with sunny days. It results from this, that the periodical
phenomena of plants and animals do not take place at about the same
time in all species, or in the individuals of any given species, as
they do in temperate countries. Of course there is no hybernation;
nor, as the dry season is not excessive, is there any summer
torpidity as in some tropical countries. Plants do not flower or
shed their leaves, nor do birds moult, pair, or breed
simultaneously. In Europe, a woodland scene has its spring, its
summer, its autumn, and its winter aspects. In the equatorial
forests the aspect is the same or nearly so every day in the year:
budding, flowering, fruiting, and leaf shedding are always going on
in one species or other. The activity of birds and insects proceeds
without interruption, each species having its own separate times;
the colonies of wasps, for instance, do not die off annually,
leaving only the queens, as in cold climates; but the succession of
generations and colonies goes on incessantly. It is never either
spring, summer, or autumn, but each day is a combination of all
three. With the day and night always of equal length, the
atmospheric disturbances of each day neutralising themselves before
each succeeding morn; with the sun in its course proceeding midway
across the sky, and the daily temperature the same within two or
three degrees throughout the year&mdash;how grand in its perfect
equilibrium and simplicity is the march of Nature under the
equator!</p>

<p>Our evenings were generally fully employed preserving our
collections, and making notes. We dined at four, and took tea about
seven o&rsquo;clock. Sometimes we walked to the city to see
Brazilian life or enjoy the pleasures of European and American
society. And so the time passed away from June 15th to August 26th.
During this period we made two excursions of greater length to the
rice and saw-mills of Magoary, an establishment owned by an
American gentleman, Mr. Upton, situated on the banks of a creek in
the heart of the forest, about twelve miles from Par&aacute;. I
will narrate some of the incidents of these excursions, and give an
account of the more interesting observations made on the Natural
History and inhabitants of these interior creeks and forests.</p>

<p>Our first trip to the mills was by land. The creek on whose
banks they stand, the Iritir&iacute;, communicates with the river
Par&aacute;, through another larger creek, the Magoary; so that
there is a passage by water; but this is about twenty miles round.
We started at sunrise, taking Isidoro with us. The road plunged at
once into the forest after leaving Nazareth, so that in a few
minutes we were enveloped in shade. For some distance the woods
were of second growth, the original forest near the town having
been formerly cleared or thinned. They were dense and impenetrable
on account of the close growth of the young trees and the mass of
thorny shrubs and creepers. These thickets swarmed with ants and
ant-thrushes; they were also frequented by a species of
puff-throated manikin, a little bird which flies occasionally
across the road, emitting a strange noise, made, I believe, with
its wings, and resembling the clatter of a small wooden rattle.</p>

<p>A mile or a mile and a half further on, the character of the
woods began to change, and we then found ourselves in the prim&aelig;val
forest. The appearance was greatly different from that of the
swampy tract I have already described. The land was rather more
elevated and undulating; the many swamp plants with their long and
broad leaves were wanting, and there was less underwood, although
the trees were wider apart. Through this wilderness the road
continued for seven or eight miles. The same unbroken forest
extends all the way to Maranham and in other directions, as we were
told, a distance of about 300 miles southward and eastward of
Par&aacute;. In almost every hollow part the road was crossed by a
brook, whose cold, dark, leaf-stained waters were bridged over by
tree trunks. The ground was carpeted, as usual, by Lycopodiums, but
it was also encumbered with masses of vegetable <i>
d&eacute;bris</i> and a thick coating of dead leaves. Fruits of
many kinds were scattered about, amongst which were many sorts of
beans, some of the pods a foot long, flat and leathery in texture,
others hard as stone. In one place there was a quantity of large
empty wooden vessels, which Isidoro told us fell from the Sapucaya
tree. They are called Monkey&rsquo;s drinking-cups (Cuyas de
Macaco), and are the capsules which contain the nuts sold under the
name just mentioned, in Covent Garden Market. At the top of the
vessel is a circular hole, in which a natural lid fits neatly. When
the nuts are ripe this lid becomes loosened and the heavy cup falls
with a crash, scattering the nuts over the ground. The tree which
yields the nut (Lecythis ollaria), is of immense height. It is
closely allied to the Brazil-nut tree (Bertholletia excelsa), whose
seeds are also enclosed in large woody vessels; but these have no
lid, and fall to the ground intact. This is the reason why the one
kind of nut is so much dearer than the other. The Sapucaya is not
less abundant, probably, than the Bertholletia, but its nuts in
falling are scattered about and eaten by wild animals; whilst the
full, whole capsules of Brazil-nuts are collected by the
natives.</p>

<p>What attracted us chiefly were the colossal trees. The general
run of trees had not remarkably thick stems; the great and uniform
height to which they grow without emitting a branch, was a much
more noticeable feature than their thickness; but at intervals of a
furlong or so a veritable giant towered up. Only one of these
monstrous trees can grow within a given space; it monopolises the
domain, and none but individuals of much inferior size can find a
footing near it. The cylindrical trunks of these larger trees were
generally about twenty to twenty-five feet in circumference. Von
Martius mentions having measured trees in the Par&aacute; district
belonging to various species (Symphonia coccinea, Lecythis sp. and
Crat&aelig;va Tapia), which were fifty to sixty feet in girth at
the point where they become cylindrical. The height of the vast
column-like stems could not be less than 100 feet from the ground
to their lowest branch. Mr. Leavens, at the sawmills, told me they
frequently squared logs for sawing a hundred feet long, of the Pao
d&rsquo;Arco and the Massaranduba. The total height of these trees,
stem and crown together, may be estimated at from 180 to 200 feet;
where one of them stands, the vast dome of foliage rises above the
other forest trees as a domed cathedral does above the other
buildings in a city.</p>

<p>A very remarkable feature in these trees is the growth of
buttress-shaped projections around the lower part of their stems.
The spaces between these buttresses, which are generally thin walls
of wood, form spacious chambers, and may be compared to stalls in a
stable; some of them are large enough to hold a half-dozen persons.
The purpose of these structures is as obvious, at the first glance,
as that of the similar props of brickwork which support a high
wall. They are not peculiar to one species, but are common to most
of the larger forest trees. Their nature and manner of growth are
explained when a series of young trees of different ages is
examined. It is then seen that they are the roots which have raised
themselves ridge-like out of the earth; growing gradually upwards
as the increasing height of the tree required augmented support.
Thus, they are plainly intended to sustain the massive crown and
trunk in these crowded forests, where lateral growth of the roots
in the earth is rendered difficult by the multitude of
competitors.</p>

<p>The other grand forest trees whose native names we learned, were
the Moira-tinga (the White or King-tree), probably the same as, or
allied to, the Mora Excelsa, which Sir Robert Schomburgh discovered
in British Guiana; the Samauma (Eriodendron Samauma) and the
Massaranduba, or Cow-tree. The last-mentioned is the most
remarkable. We had already heard a good deal about this tree, and
about its producing from its bark a copious supply of milk as
pleasant to drink as that of the cow. We had also eaten its fruit
in Par&aacute;, where it is sold in the streets by negro market
women; and had heard a good deal of the durableness in water of its
timber. We were glad, therefore, to see this wonderful tree growing
in its native wilds. It is one of the largest of the forest
monarchs, and is peculiar in appearance on account of its
deeply-scored reddish and ragged bark. A decoction of the bark, I
was told, is used as a red dye for cloth. A few days afterwards we
tasted its milk, which was drawn from dry logs that had been
standing many days in the hot sun, at the saw-mills. It was
pleasant with coffee, but had a slight rankness when drunk pure; it
soon thickens to a glue, which is excessively tenacious, and is
often used to cement broken crockery. I was told that it was not
safe to drink much of it, for a slave had recently nearly lost his
life through taking it too freely.</p>

<p>In some parts of the road ferns were conspicuous objects. But I
afterwards found them much more numerous on the Maranham road,
especially in one place where the whole forest glade formed a vast
fernery; the ground was covered with terrestrial species, and the
tree trunks clothed with climbing and epiphytous kinds. I saw no
tree ferns in the Par&aacute; district; they belong to hilly
regions; some occur, however, on the Upper Amazons.</p>

<p>Such were the principal features in the vegetation of the
wilderness; but where were the flowers? To our great disappointment
we saw none, or only such as were insignificant in appearance.
Orchids are very rare in the dense forests of the low lands. I
believe it is now tolerably well ascertained that the majority of
forest trees in equatorial Brazil have small and inconspicuous
flowers. Flower-frequenting insects are also rare in the forest. Of
course they would not be found where their favourite food was
wanting, but I always noticed that even where flowers occurred in
the forest, few or no insects were seen upon them. In the open
country or campos of Santarem on the Lower Amazons, flowering trees
and bushes are more abundant, and there a large number of floral
insects are attracted. The forest bees of South America belonging
to the genera Melipona and Euglossa are more frequently seen
feeding on the sweet sap which exudes from the trees or on the
excrement of birds on leaves, rather than on flowers.</p>

<p>We were disappointed also in not meeting with any of the larger
animals in the forest. There was no tumultuous movement, or sound
of life. We did not see or hear monkeys, and no tapir or jaguar
crossed our path. Birds, also, appeared to be exceedingly scarce.
We heard, however, occasionally, the long-drawn, wailing note of
the Inambu, a kind of partridge (Crypturus cinereus?); and, also,
in the hollows on the banks, of the rivulets, the noisy notes of
another bird, which seemed to go in pairs, amongst the tree-tops,
calling to each other as they went. These notes resounded through
the wilderness. Another solitary bird had a most sweet and
melancholy song; it consisted simply of a few notes, uttered in a
plaintive key, commencing high, and descending by harmonic
intervals. It was probably a species of warbler of the genus
Trichas. All these notes of birds are very striking and
characteristic of the forest.</p>

<p>I afterwards saw reason to modify my opinion, founded on these
first impressions, with regard to the amount and variety of animal
life in this and other parts of the Amazonian forests. There is, in
fact, a great variety of mammals, birds, and reptiles, but they are
widely scattered, and all excessively shy of man. The region is so
extensive, and uniform in the forest clothing of its surface, that
it is only at long intervals that animals are seen in abundance
when some particular spot is found which is more attractive than
others. Brazil, moreover, is poor throughout in terrestrial
mammals, and the species are of small size; they do not, therefore,
form a conspicuous feature in its forests. The huntsman would be
disappointed who expected to find here flocks of animals similar to
the buffalo herds of North America, or the swarms of antelopes and
herds of ponderous pachyderms of Southern Africa. The largest and
most interesting portion of the Brazilian mammal fauna is arboreal
in its habits; this feature of the animal denizens of these forests
I have already alluded to. The most <i>intensely</i> arboreal
animals in the world are the South American monkeys of the family
Cebid&aelig;, many of which have a fifth hand for climbing in their
prehensile tails, adapted for this function by their strong
muscular development, and the naked palms under their tips. This
seems to teach us that the South American fauna has been slowly
adapted to a forest life, and, therefore, that extensive forests
must have always existed since the region was first peopled by
mammalia. But to this subject, and to the natural history of the
monkeys, of which thirty-eight species inhabit the Amazon region, I
shall have to return.</p>

<br>


<center><img src="images/fig4.jpg" width="468" height="313" alt=
"Interior of Prim&aelig;val Forest on the Amazons"></center>

<p>We often read, in books of travels, of the silence and gloom of
the Brazilian forests. They are realities, and the impression
deepens on a longer acquaintance. The few sounds of birds are of
that pensive or mysterious character which intensifies the feeling
of solitude rather than imparts a sense of life and cheerfulness.
Sometimes, in the midst of the stillness, a sudden yell or scream
will startle one; this comes from some defenseless fruit-eating
animal, which is pounced upon by a tiger-cat or stealthy
boa-constrictor. Morning and evening the howling monkeys make a
most fearful and harrowing noise, under which it is difficult to
keep up one&rsquo;s buoyancy of spirit. The feeling of inhospitable
wildness, which the forest is calculated to inspire, is increased
tenfold under this fearful uproar. Often, even in the still hours
of midday, a sudden crash will be heard resounding afar through the
wilderness, as some great bough or entire tree falls to the ground.
There are, besides, many sounds which it is impossible to account
for. I found the natives generally as much at a loss in this
respect as myself. Sometimes a sound is heard like the clang of an
iron bar against a hard, hollow tree, or a piercing cry rends the
air; these are not repeated, and the succeeding silence tends to
heighten the unpleasant impression which they make on the mind.
With the native it is always the Curup&iacute;ra, the wild man or
spirit of the forest, which produces all noises they are unable to
explain. For myths are the rude theories which mankind, in the
infancy of knowledge, invent to explain natural phenomena. The
Curup&iacute;ra is a mysterious being, whose attributes are
uncertain, for they vary according to locality. Sometimes he is
described as a kind of orang-otang, being covered with long, shaggy
hair, and living in trees. At others, he is said to have cloven
feet and a bright red face. He has a wife and children, and
sometimes comes down to the ro&ccedil;as to steal the mandioca. At
one time I had a Mameluco youth in my service, whose head was full
of the legends and superstitions of the country. He always went
with me into the forest; in fact, I could not get him to go alone,
and whenever we heard any of the strange noises mentioned above, he
used to tremble with fear. He would crouch down behind me, and beg
of me to turn back; his alarm ceasing only after he had made a
charm to protect us from the Curup&iacute;ra. For this purpose, he
took a young palm leaf, plaited it, and formed it into a ring,
which he hung to a branch on our track.</p>

<p>At length, after a six hours&rsquo; walk, we arrived at our
destination, the last mile or two having been again through
second-growth forest. The mills formed a large pile of buildings,
pleasantly situated in a cleared tract of land, many acres in
extent, and everywhere surrounded by the perpetual forest. We were
received in the kindest manner by the overseer, Mr. Leavens, who
showed us all that was interesting about the place, and took us to
the best spots in the neighbourhood for birds and insects. The
mills were built a long time ago by a wealthy Brazilian. They had
belonged to Mr. Upton for many years. I was told that when the
dark-skinned revolutionists were preparing for their attack on
Par&aacute;, they occupied the place, but not the slightest injury
was done to the machinery or building, for the leaders said it was
against the Portuguese and their party that they were at war, not
against the other foreigners.</p>

<p>The creek Iritir&iacute; at the mills is only a few yards wide;
it winds about between two lofty walls of forest for some distance,
then becomes much broader, and finally joins the Magoary. There are
many other ramifications, creeks or channels, which lead to retired
hamlets and scattered houses, inhabited by people of mixed white,
Indian, and negro descent. Many of them did business with Mr.
Leavens, bringing for sale their little harvests of rice, or a few
logs of timber. It was interesting to see them in their little,
heavily-laden montarias. Sometimes the boats were managed by
handsome, healthy young lads, loosely clad in a straw hat, white
shirt, and dark blue trousers, turned up to the knee. They steered,
paddled, and managed the varejao (the boating pole), with much
grace and dexterity.</p>

<p>We made many excursions down the Iritir&iacute;, and saw much of
these creeks; besides, our second visit to the mills was by water.
The Magoary is a magnificent channel; the different branches form
quite a labyrinth, and the land is everywhere of little elevation.
All these smaller rivers, throughout the Par&aacute; Estuary, are
of the nature of creeks. The land is so level, that the short local
rivers have no sources and downward currents like rivers as we
generally understand them. They serve the purpose of draining the
land, but instead of having a constant current one way, they have a
regular ebb and flow with the tide. The natives call them, in the
Tup&iacute; language, Igarap&eacute;s, or canoe-paths. The
igarap&eacute;s and furos or channels, which are infinite in number
in this great river delta, are characteristic of the country. The
land is everywhere covered with impenetrable forests; the houses
and villages are all on the waterside, and nearly all communication
is by water. This semi-aquatic life of the people is one of the
most interesting features of the country. For short excursions, and
for fishing in still waters, a small boat, called montaria, is
universally used. It is made of five planks; a broad one for the
bottom, bent into the proper shape by the action of heat, two
narrow ones for the sides, and two small triangular pieces for stem
and stern. It has no rudder; the paddle serves for both steering
and propelling. The montaria takes here the place of the horse,
mule, or camel of other regions. Besides one or more montarias,
almost every family has a larger canoe, called Igarit&eacute;. This
is fitted with two masts, a rudder, and keel, and has an arched
awning or cabin near the stern, made of a framework of tough lianas
thatched with palm leaves. In the igarit&eacute; they will cross
stormy rivers fifteen or twenty miles broad. The natives are all
boat-builders. It is often remarked, by white residents, that an
Indian is a carpenter and shipwright by intuition. It is
astonishing to see in what crazy vessels these people will risk
themselves. I have seen Indians cross rivers in a leaky montaria,
when it required the nicest equilibrium to keep the leak just above
water; a movement of a hair&rsquo;s breadth would send all to the
bottom, but they managed to cross in safety. They are especially
careful when they have strangers under their charge, and it is the
custom of Brazilian and Portuguese travellers to leave the whole
management to them. When they are alone they are more reckless, and
often have to swim for their lives. If a squall overtakes them as
they are crossing in a heavily-laden canoe, they all jump overboard
and swim about until the heavy sea subsides, then they
re-embark.</p>

<br>
<p>A few words on the aboriginal population of the Par&aacute;
estuary will not be out of place here. The banks of the Par&aacute;
were originally inhabited by a number of distinct tribes, who, in
their habits, resembled very much the natives of the sea-coast from
Maranham to Bahia. It is related that one large tribe, the
Tupinambas, migrated from Pernambuco to the Amazons. One fact seems
to be well-established, namely, that all the coast tribes were far
more advanced in civilisation, and milder in their manners, than
the savages who inhabited the interior lands of Brazil. They were
settled in villages, and addicted to agriculture. They navigated
the rivers in large canoes, called ubas, made of immense
hollowed-out tree trunks; in these they used to go on war
expeditions, carrying in the prows their trophies and calabash
rattles, whose clatter was meant to intimidate their enemies. They
were gentle in disposition, and received the early Portuguese
settlers with great friendliness. The inland savages, on the other
hand, led a wandering life, as they do at the present time, only
coming down occasionally to rob the plantations of the coast
tribes, who always entertained the greatest enmity towards
them.</p>

<p>The original Indian tribes of the district are now either
civilised, or have amalgamated with the white and negro immigrants.
Their distinguishing tribal names have long been forgotten, and the
race bears now the general appellation of Tapuyo, which seems to
have been one of the names of the ancient Tupinambas. The Indians
of the interior, still remaining in the savage state, are called by
the Brazilians Indios, or Gentios (Heathens). All the
semi-civilised Tapuyos of the villages, and in fact the inhabitants
of retired places generally, speak the Lingoa geral, a language
adapted by the Jesuit missionaries from the original idiom of the
Tupinambas. The language of the Guaranis, a nation living on the
banks of the Par&aacute;guay, is a dialect of it, and hence it is
called by philologists the Tupi-Guarani language; printed grammars
of it are always on sale at the shops of the Par&aacute;
booksellers. The fact of one language having been spoken over so
wide an extent of country as that from the Amazons to
Par&aacute;guay, is quite an isolated one in this country, and
points to considerable migrations of the Indian tribes in former
times. At present the languages spoken by neighbouring tribes on
the banks of the interior rivers are totally distinct; on the
Juru&aacute;, even scattered hordes belonging to the same tribe are
not able to understand each other.</p>

<p>The civilised Tapuyo of Par&aacute; differs in no essential
point, in physical or moral qualities, from the Indian of the
interior. He is more stoutly built, being better fed than some of
them; but in this respect there are great differences amongst the
tribes themselves. He presents all the chief characteristics of the
American red man. The skin of a coppery brown colour, the features
of the face broad, and the hair black, thick, and straight. He is
generally about the middle height, thick-set, has a broad muscular
chest, well-shaped but somewhat thick legs and arms, and small
hands and feet. The cheek bones are not generally prominent; the
eyes are black, and seldom oblique like those of the Tartar races
of Eastern Asia, which are supposed to have sprung from the same
original stock as the American red man. The features exhibit
scarcely any mobility of expression; this is connected with the
excessively apathetic and undemonstrative character of the race.
They never betray, in fact they do not feel keenly, the emotions of
joy, grief, wonder, fear, and so forth. They can never be excited
to enthusiasm; but they have strong affections, especially those
connected with family. It is commonly stated by the whites and
negroes that the Tapuyo is ungrateful. Brazilian mistresses of
households, who have much experience of Indians, have always a long
list of instances to relate to the stranger, showing their base
ingratitude. They certainly do not appear to remember or think of
repaying benefits, but this is probably because they did not
require, and do not value such benefits as their would-be masters
confer upon them. I have known instances of attachment and fidelity
on the part of Indians towards their masters, but these are
exceptional cases. All the actions of the Indian show that his
ruling desire is to be let alone; he is attached to his home, his
quiet monotonous forest and river life; he likes to go to towns
occasionally, to see the wonders introduced by the white man, but
he has a great repugnance to living in the midst of the crowd; he
prefers handicraft to field labour, and especially dislikes binding
himself to regular labour for hire. He is shy and uneasy before
strangers, but if they visit his abode, he treats them well, for he
has a rooted appreciation of the duty of hospitality; there is a
pride about him, and being naturally formal and polite, he acts the
host with great dignity. He withdraws from towns as soon as the
stir of civilisation begins to make itself felt. When we first
arrived at Par&aacute; many Indian families resided there, for the
mode of living at that time was more like that of a large village
than a city; but as soon as river steamers and more business
activity were introduced, they all gradually took themselves
away.</p>

<p>These characteristics of the Par&aacute; Indians are applicable,
of course, to some extent, to the Mamelucos, who now constitute a
great proportion of the population. The inflexibility of character
of the Indian, and his total inability to accommodate himself to
new arrangements, will infallibly lead to his extinction, as
immigrants, endowed with more supple organisations, increase, and
civilisation advances in the Amazon region. But, as the different
races amalgamate readily, and the offspring of white and Indian
often become distinguished Brazilian citizens, there is little
reason to regret the fate of the race. Formerly the Indian was
harshly treated, and even now he is so, in many parts of the
interior. But, according to the laws of Brazil, he is a free
citizen, having equal privileges with the whites; and there are
very strong enactments providing against the enslaving and
ill-treatment of the Indians. The residents of the interior, who
have no higher principles to counteract instinctive selfishness or
antipathy of race, cannot comprehend why they are not allowed to
compel Indians to work for them, seeing that they will not do it of
their own accord. The inevitable result of the conflict of
interests between a European and a weaker indigenous race, when the
two come in contact, is the sacrifice of the latter. In the
Par&aacute; district, the Indians are no longer enslaved, but they
are deprived of their lands, and this they feel bitterly, as one of
them, an industrious and worthy man, related to me. Is not a
similar state of things now exhibited in New Zealand, between the
Maoris and the English colonists?</p>

<p>It is very interesting to read of the bitter contests that were
carried on from the year 1570 to 1759, between the Portuguese
immigrants in Brazil, and the Jesuit and other missionaries. They
were similar to those which have recently taken place in South
Africa, between the Boers and the English missionaries, but they
were on a much larger scale. The Jesuits, as far as I could glean
from tradition and history, were actuated by the same motives as
our missionaries; and they seemed like them to have been, in great
measure, successful, in teaching the pure and elevated Christian
morality to the simple natives. But the attempt was vain to protect
the weaker race from the inevitable ruin which awaited it in the
natural struggle with the stronger one; in 1759, the white
colonists finally prevailed, the Jesuits were forced to leave the
country, and the fifty-one happy mission villages went to ruin.
Since then, the aboriginal race has gone on decreasing in numbers
under the treatment which it has received; it is now, as I have
already stated, protected by the laws of the central
government.</p>

<br>
<p>On our second visit to the mills, we stayed ten days. There is a
large reservoir and also a natural lake near the place, both
containing aquatic plants, whose leaves rest on the surface like
our water lilies, but they are not so elegant as our nymph&aelig;a,
either in leaf or flower. On the banks of these pools grow
quantities of a species of fan-leaved palm tree, the Carana, whose
stems are surrounded by whorls of strong spines. I sometimes took a
montaria, and paddled myself alone down the creek. One day I got
upset, and had to land on a grassy slope leading to an old
plantation, where I ran about naked whilst my clothes were being
dried on a bush. The creek Iritir&iacute; is not so picturesque as
many others which I subsequently explored. Towards the Magoary, the
banks at the edge of the water are clothed with mangrove bushes,
and beneath them the muddy banks into which the long roots that
hang down from the fruit before it leaves the branches strike their
fibres, swarm with crabs. On the lower branches the beautiful bird,
Ardea helias, is found. This is a small heron of exquisitely
graceful shape and mien; its plumage is minutely variegated with
bars and spots of many colours, like the wings of certain kinds of
moths. It is difficult to see the bird in the woods, on account of
its sombre colours, and the shadiness of its dwelling-places; but
its note, a soft long-drawn whistle, often betrays its hiding
place. I was told by the Indians that it builds in trees, and that
the nest, which is made of clay, is beautifully constructed. It is
a favourite pet-bird of the Brazilians, who call it Pavao
(pronounced Pavaong), or peacock. I often had opportunities to
observe its habits. It soon becomes tame, and walks about the
floors of houses picking up scraps of food or catching insects,
which it secures by walking gently to the place where they settle,
and spearing them with its long, slender beak. It allows itself to
be handled by children, and will answer to its name &ldquo;Pavao!
Pavao!&rdquo; walking up with a dainty, circumspect gait, and
taking a fly or beetle from the hand.</p>

<p>During these rambles by land and water we increased our
collections considerably. Before we left the mills, we arranged a
joint excursion to the Tocantins. Mr. Leavens wished to ascend that
river to ascertain if the reports were true, that cedar grew
abundantly between the lowermost cataract and the mouth of the
Araguava, and we agreed to accompany him.</p>

<p>Whilst we were at the mills, a Portuguese trader arrived with a
quantity of worm-eaten logs of this cedar, which he had gathered
from the floating timber in the current of the main Amazons. The
tree producing this wood, which is named cedar on account of the
similarity of its aroma to that of the true cedars, is not, of
course, a coniferous tree, as no member of that class is found in
equatorial America, at least in the Amazons region. It is,
according to Von Martius, the Cedrela Odorata, an exogen belonging
to the same order as the mahogany tree. The wood is light, and the
tree is therefore, on falling into the water, floated down with the
river currents. It must grow in great quantities somewhere in the
interior, to judge from the number of uprooted trees annually
carried to the sea, and as the wood is much esteemed for cabinet
work and canoe building, it is of some importance to learn where a
regular supply can be obtained. We were glad of course to arrange
with Mr. Leavens, who was familiar with the language, and an adept
in river navigation&mdash;so we returned to Par&aacute; to ship our
collections for England, and prepare for the journey to a new
region.</p>
