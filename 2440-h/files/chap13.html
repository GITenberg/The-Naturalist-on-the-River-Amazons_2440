<p class="first"><i>November 7th, 1856.</i>&mdash;Embarked on the
Upper Amazons steamer, the <i>Tabatinga</i>, for an excursion to
Tunantins, a small semi-Indian settlement, lying 240 miles beyond
Ega. The <i>Tabatinga</i> is an iron boat of about 170 tons
burthen, built at Rio de Janeiro, and fitted with engines of fifty
horse-power. The saloon, with berths on each side for twenty
passengers, is above deck, and open at both ends to admit a free
current of air. The captain or &ldquo;commandante,&rdquo; was a
lieutenant in the Brazilian navy, a man of polished, sailor-like
address, and a rigid disciplinarian; his name, Senhor Nunes Mello
Cardozo. I was obliged, as usual, to take with me a stock of all
articles of food, except meat and fish, for the time I intended to
be absent (three months); and the luggage, including hammocks,
cooking utensils, crockery, and so forth, formed fifteen large
packages. One bundle consisted of a mosquito tent, an article I had
not yet had occasion to use on the river, but which was
indispensable in all excursions beyond Ega, every person, man,
woman and child, requiring one, as without it existence would be
scarcely possible. My tent was about eight feet long and five feet
broad, and was made of coarse calico in an oblong shape, with
sleeves at each end through which to pass the cords of a hammock.
Under this shelter, which is fixed up every evening before sundown,
one can read and write, or swing in one&rsquo;s hammock during the
long hours which intervene before bedtime, and feel one&rsquo;s
sense of comfort increased by having cheated the thirsty swarms of
mosquitoes which fill the chamber.</p>

<p>We were four days on the road. The pilot, a Mameluco of Ega,
whom I knew very well, exhibited a knowledge of the river and
powers of endurance which were quite remarkable. He stood all this
time at his post, with the exception of three or four hours in the
middle of each day, when he was relieved by a young man who served
as apprentice, and he knew the breadth and windings of the channel,
and the extent of all the yearly-shifting shoals from the Rio Negro
to Loreto, a distance of more than a thousand miles. There was no
slackening of speed at night, except during the brief but violent
storms which occasionally broke upon us, and then the engines were
stopped by the command of Lieutenant Nunes, sometimes against the
wish of the pilot. The nights were often so dark that we passengers
on the poop deck could not discern the hardy fellow on the bridge,
but the steamer drove on at full speed, men being stationed on the
look-out at the prow, to watch for floating logs, and one man
placed to pass orders to the helmsman; the keel scraped against a
sand-bank only once during the passage.</p>

<p>The passengers were chiefly Peruvians, mostly thin, anxious,
Yankee-looking men, who were returning home to the cities of
Moyobamba and Chachapoyas, on the Andes, after a trading trip to
the Brazilian towns on the Atlantic seaboard, whither they had gone
six months previously, with cargoes of Panama hats to exchange for
European wares. These hats are made of the young leaflets of a palm
tree, by the Indians and half-caste people who inhabit the eastern
parts of Peru. They form almost the only article of export from
Peru by way of the Amazons, but the money value is very great
compared with the bulk of the goods, as the hats are generally of
very fine quality, and cost from twelve shillings to six pounds
sterling each; some traders bring down two or three thousand
pounds&rsquo; worth, folded into small compass in their trunks. The
return cargoes consist of hardware, crockery, glass, and other
bulky or heavy goods, but not of cloth, which, being of light
weight, can be carried across the Andes from the ports on the
Pacific to the eastern parts of Peru. All kinds of European cloth
can be obtained at a much cheaper rate by this route than by the
more direct way of the Amazons, the import duties of Peru being, as
I was told, lower than those of Brazil, and the difference not
being counter-balanced by increased expense of transit, on account
of weight, over the passes of the Andes.</p>

<p>There was a great lack of amusement on board. The table was very
well served, professed cooks being employed in these Amazonian
steamers, and fresh meat insured by keeping on deck a supply of
live bullocks and fowls, which are purchased whenever there is an
opportunity on the road. The river scenery was similar to that
already described as presented between the Rio Negro and Ega: long
reaches of similar aspect, with two long, low lines of forest,
varied sometimes with cliffs of red clay, appearing one after the
other; an horizon of water and sky on some days limiting the view
both up stream and down. We travelled, however, always near the
bank, and, for my part, I was never weary of admiring the
picturesque grouping and variety of trees, and the varied mantles
of creeping plants which clothed the green wall of forest every
step of the way. With the exception of a small village called Fonte
Boa, retired from the main river, where we stopped to take in
firewood, and which I shall have to speak of presently, we saw no
human habitation the whole of the distance. The mornings were
delightfully cool; coffee was served at sunrise, and a bountiful
breakfast at ten o&rsquo;clock; after that hour the heat rapidly
increased until it became almost unbearable. How the engine-drivers
and firemen stood it without exhaustion I cannot tell; it
diminished after four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, about which
time dinner-bell rung, and the evenings were always pleasant.</p>

<p><i>November 11th to 30th.</i>&mdash;The Tunantins is a sluggish
black-water stream, about sixty miles in length, and towards its
mouth from 100 to 200 yards in breadth. The vegetation on its banks
has a similar aspect to that of the Rio Negro, the trees having
small foliage of a sombre hue, and the dark piles of greenery
resting on the surface of the inky water. The village is situated
on the left bank, about a mile from the mouth of the river, and
contains twenty habitations, nearly all of which are merely hovels,
built of lath-work and mud. The short streets, after rain, are
almost impassable on account of the many puddles, and are choked up
with weeds&mdash;leguminous shrubs, and scarlet-flowered asclepias.
The atmosphere in such a place, hedged in as it is by the lofty
forest, and surrounded by swamps, is always close, warm, and
reeking; and the hum and chirp of insects and birds cause a
continual din. The small patch of weedy ground around the village
swarms with plovers, sandpipers, striped herons, and scissor-tailed
fly-catchers; and alligators are always seen floating lazily on the
surface of the river in front of the houses.</p>

<p>On landing, I presented myself to Senhor Paulo Bitancourt, a
good-natured half-caste, director of Indians of the neighbouring
river Iss&aacute;, who quickly ordered a small house to be cleared
for me. This exhilarating abode contained only one room, the walls
of which were disfigured by large and ugly patches of mud, the work
of white ants. The floor was the bare earth, dirty and damp, the
wretched chamber was darkened by a sheet of calico being stretched
over the windows, a plan adopted here to keep out the Pium-flies,
which float about in all shady places like thin clouds of smoke,
rendering all repose impossible in the daytime wherever they can
effect an entrance. My baggage was soon landed, and before the
steamer departed I had taken gun, insect-net, and game-bag, to make
a preliminary exploration of my new locality.</p>

<p>I remained here nineteen days, and, considering the shortness of
the time, made a very good collection of monkeys, birds, and
insects. A considerable number of the species (especially of
insects) were different from those of the four other stations,
which I examined on the south side of the Solimoens, and as many of
these were &ldquo;representative forms&rdquo;<sup><a href=
"#1">1</a></sup> of others found on the opposite banks of the broad
river, I concluded that there could have been no land connection
between the two shores during, at least, the recent geological
period. This conclusion is confirmed by the case of the
Uakar&iacute; monkeys, described in the last chapter. All these
strongly modified local races of insects confined to one side of
the Solimoens (like the Uakar&iacute;s), are such as have not been
able to cross a wide treeless space such as a river. The
acquisition which pleased me most, in this place, was a new species
of butterfly (a Catagramma), which has since been named C.
excelsior, owing to its surpassing in size and beauty all the
previously-known species of its singularly beautiful genus. The
upper surface of the wings is of the richest blue, varying in shade
with the play of light, and on each side is a broad curved stripe
of an orange colour. It is a bold flyer, and is not confined, as I
afterwards found, to the northern side of the river, for I once saw
a specimen amidst a number of richly-coloured butterflies, flying
about the deck of the steamer when we were anchored off Fonte Boa,
200 miles, lower down the river.</p>

<p>With the exception of three Mameluco families and a stray
Portuguese trader, all the inhabitants of the village and
neighbourhood are semi-civilised Indians of the Shum&aacute;na and
Pass&eacute; tribes. The forests of the Tunantins, however, are
inhabited by a tribe of wild Indians called Caish&aacute;nas, who
resemble much, in their social condition and manners, the debased
Mur&aacute;s of the Lower Amazons, and have, like them, shown no
aptitude for civilised life in any shape. Their huts commence at
the distance of an hour&rsquo;s walk from the village, along gloomy
and narrow forest paths. My first and only visit to a
Caish&aacute;na dwelling was accidental. One day, having extended
my walk further than usual, and followed one of the forest-roads
until it became a mere <i>picada</i>, or hunters&rsquo; track, I
came suddenly upon a well-trodden pathway, bordered on each side
with Lycopodia of the most elegant shapes, the tips of the fronds
stretching almost like tendrils down the little earthy slopes which
formed the edge of the path. The road, though smooth, was narrow
and dark, and in many places blocked up by trunks of felled trees,
which had been apparently thrown across by the timid Indians on
purpose to obstruct the way to their habitations. Half-a-mile of
this shady road brought me to a small open space on the banks of a
brook or creek, on the skirts of which stood a conical hut with a
very low doorway. There was also an open shed, with stages made of
split palm-stems, and a number of large wooden troughs. Two or
three dark-skinned children, with a man and woman, were in the
shed; but, immediately on espying me, all of them ran to the hut,
bolting through the little doorway like so many wild animals scared
into their burrows. A few moments after, the man put his head out
with a look of great distrust; but, on my making the most friendly
gestures I could think of, he came forth with the children. They
were all smeared with black mud and paint; the only clothing of the
elders was a kind of apron made of the inner bark of the
sapucaya-tree, and the savage aspect of the man was heightened by
his hair hanging over his forehead to the eyes. I stayed about two
hours in the neighbourhood, the children gaining sufficient
confidence to come and help me to search for insects. The only
weapon used by the Caish&aacute;nas is the blow-gun, and this is
employed only in shooting animals for food. They are not a warlike
people, like most of the neighbouring tribes on the Japur&aacute;
and Iss&aacute;.</p>

<p>The whole tribe of Caish&aacute;nas does not exceed 400 souls in
number. None of them are baptised Indians, and they do not dwell in
villages, like the more advanced sections of the Tupi stock; but
each family has its own solitary hut. They are quite harmless, do
not practise tattooing, or perforate their ears and noses in any
way. Their social condition is of a low type, very little removed,
indeed, from that of the brutes living in the same forests. They do
not appear to obey any common chief, and I could not make out that
they had Paj&eacute;s, or medicine-men, those rudest beginnings of
a priest class. Symbolical or masked dances, and ceremonies in
honour of the Jurupar&iacute;, or demon, customs which prevail
amongst all the surrounding tribes, are unknown to the
Caish&aacute;nas. There is among them a trace of festival keeping;
but the only ceremony used is the drinking of cashiri beer, and
fermented liquors made of Indian-corn, bananas, and so forth. These
affairs, however, are conducted in a degenerate style, for they do
not drink to intoxication, or sustain the orgies for several days
and nights in succession, like the Jur&iacute;s Pass&eacute;s, and
Tuc&uacute;nas. The men play a musical instrument, made of pieces
of stem of the arrow-grass cut in different lengths and arranged
like Pan-pipes. With this they wile away whole hours, lolling in
ragged, bast hammocks slung in their dark, smoky huts. The
Tunantins people say that the Caish&aacute;nas have persecuted the
wild animals and birds to such an extent near their settlements
that there is now quite a scarcity of animal food. If they kill a
Toucan, it is considered an important event, and the bird is made
to serve as a meal for a score or more persons. They boil the meat
in earthenware kettles filled with Tucupi sauce, and eat it with
beiju, or mandioca-cakes. The women are not allowed to taste of the
meat, but forced to content themselves with sopping pieces of cake
in the liquor.</p>

<p><i>November 30th.</i>&mdash;I left Tunantins in a trading
schooner of eighty tons burthen belonging to Senhor Batalha, a
tradesman of Ega, which had been out all the summer collecting
produce, and was commanded by a friend of mine, a young Paraense,
named Francisco Raiol. We arrived, on the 3rd of December, at the
mouth of the Jutah&iacute;, a considerable stream about half a mile
broad, and flowing with a very sluggish current. This is one of the
series of six rivers, from 400 to 1000 miles in length, which flow
from the south-west through unknown lands lying between Bolivia and
the Upper Amazons, and enter this latter river between the Madeira
and the Ucay&aacute;li. We remained at anchor four days within the
mouth of the Sap&oacute;, a small tributary of the Jutah&iacute;
flowing from the south-east; Senhor Raiol having to send an
igarit&eacute; to the Cupat&aacute;na, a large tributary some few
miles farther up the river, to fetch a cargo of salt-fish. During
this time we made several excursions in the montaria to various
places in the neighbourhood. Our longest trip was to some Indian
houses, a distance of fifteen or eighteen miles up the Sap&oacute;,
a journey made with one Indian paddler, and occupying a whole day.
The stream is not more than forty or fifty yards broad; its waters
are darker in colour than those of the Jutah&iacute;, and flow, as
in all these small rivers, partly under shade between two lofty
walls of forest. We passed, in ascending, seven habitations, most
of them hidden in the luxuriant foliage of the banks; their sites
being known only by small openings in the compact wall of forest,
and the presence of a canoe or two tied up in little shady ports.
The inhabitants are chiefly Indians of the Marau&aacute; tribe,
whose original territory comprised all the small by-streams lying
between the Jutah&iacute; and the Juru&aacute;, near the mouths of
both these great tributaries. They live in separate families or
small hordes, have no common chief, and are considered as a tribe
little disposed to adopt civilised customs or be friendly with the
whites. One of the houses belonged to a Jur&iacute; family, and we
saw the owner, an erect, noble-looking old fellow, tattooed, as
customary with his tribe, in a large patch over the middle of his
face, fishing under the shade of a colossal tree in his port with
hook and line. He saluted us in the usual grave and courteous
manner of the better sort of Indians as we passed by.</p>

<p>We reached the last house, or rather two houses, about ten
o&rsquo;clock, and spent several hours there during the great heat
of midday. The houses, which stood on a high clayey bank, were of
quadrangular shape, partly open like sheds, and partly enclosed
with rude mud-walls, forming one or more chambers. The inhabitants,
a few families of Marau&aacute;s, comprising about thirty persons,
received us in a frank, smiling manner: a reception which may have
been due to Senhor Raiol being an old acquaintance and somewhat of
a favourite. None of them were tattooed; but the men had great
holes pierced in their ear-lobes, in which they insert plugs of
wood, and their lips were drilled with smaller holes. One of the
younger men, a fine strapping fellow nearly six feet high, with a
large aquiline nose, who seemed to wish to be particularly friendly
with me, showed me the use of these lip-holes, by fixing a number
of little white sticks in them, and then twisting his mouth about
and going through a pantomime to represent defiance in the presence
of an enemy. Nearly all the people were disfigured by dark blotches
on the skin, the effect of a cutaneous disease very prevalent in
this part of the country. The face of one old man was completely
blackened, and looked as though it had been smeared with black
lead, the blotches having coalesced to form one large patch. Others
were simply mottled; the black spots were hard and rough, but not
scaly, and were margined with rings of a colour paler than the
natural hue of the skin. I had seen many Indians and a few
half-castes at Tunantins, and afterwards saw others at Fonte Boa,
blotched in the same way. The disease would seem to be contagious,
for I was told that a Portuguese trader became disfigured with it
after cohabiting some years with an Indian woman. It is curious
that, although prevalent in many places on the Solimoens, no
resident of Ega exhibited signs of the disease: the early explorers
of the country, on noticing spotted skins to be very frequent in
certain localities, thought they were peculiar to a few tribes of
Indians. The younger children in these houses on the Sap&oacute;
were free from spots; but two or three of them, about ten years of
age, showed signs of their commencement in rounded yellowish
patches on the skin, and these appeared languid and sickly,
although the blotched adults seemed not to be affected in their
general health. A middle-aged half-caste at Fonte Boa told me he
had cured himself of the disorder by strong doses of sarsaparilla;
the black patches had caused the hair of his beard and eyebrows to
fall off, but it had grown again since his cure.</p>

<p>When my tall friend saw me, after dinner, collecting insects
along the paths near the houses, he approached, and, taking me by
the arm, led me to a mandioca shed, making signs, as he could speak
very little Tupi, that he had something to show. I was not a little
surprised when, having mounted the girao, or stage of split
palm-stems, and taken down an object transfixed to a post, he
exhibited, with an air of great mystery, a large chrysalis
suspended from a leaf, which he placed carefully in my hands,
saying, &ldquo;P&aacute;na-pan&aacute; cur&iacute;&rdquo;
(Tup&iacute;: butterfly by-and-by). Thus I found that the
metamorphoses of insects were known to these savages; but being
unable to talk with my new friend, I could not ascertain what ideas
such a phenomenon had given rise to in his mind. The good fellow
did not leave my side during the remainder of our stay; but,
thinking apparently that I had come here for information, he put
himself to considerable trouble to give me all he could. He made a
quantity of Hypad&uacute; or Coca powder that I might see the
process; going about the task with much action and ceremony, as
though he were a conjuror performing some wonderful trick.</p>

<p>We left these friendly people about four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon, and in descending the umbrageous river, stopped, about
half-way down, at another house, built in one of the most charming
situations I had yet seen in this country. A clean, narrow, sandy
pathway led from the shady port to the house, through a tract of
forest of indescribable luxuriance. The buildings stood on an
eminence in the middle of a level cleared space; the firm sandy
soil, smooth as a floor, forming a broad terrace around them. The
owner was a semi-civilised Indian, named Manoel; a dull, taciturn
fellow, who, together with his wife and children, seemed by no
means pleased at being intruded on in their solitude. The family
must have been very industrious, for the plantations were very
extensive, and included a little of almost all kinds of cultivated
tropical productions: fruit trees, vegetables, and even flowers for
ornament. The silent old man had surely a fine appreciation of the
beauties of nature, for the site he had chosen commanded a view of
surprising magnificence over the summits of the forest; and, to
give finish to the prospect, he had planted a large quantity of
banana trees in the foreground, thus concealing the charred and
dead stumps which would otherwise have marred the effect of the
rolling sea of greenery. The only information I could get out of
Manoel was, that large flocks of richly-coloured birds came down in
the fruit season and despoiled his trees. The sun set over the
tree-tops before we left this little Eden, and the remainder of our
journey was made slowly and pleasantly, under the chequered shades
of the river banks, by the light of the moon.</p>

<br>
<p><i>December 7th.</i>&mdash;Arrived at Fonte Boa; a wretched,
muddy, and dilapidated village situated two or three miles within
the mouth of a narrow by-stream called the Cayhiar-hy, which runs
almost as straight as an artificial canal between the village and
the main Amazons. The character of the vegetation and soil here was
different from that of all other localities I had hitherto
examined; I had planned, therefore, to devote six weeks to the
place. Having written beforehand to one of the principal
inhabitants, Senhor Venancio, a house was ready for me on landing.
The only recommendation of the dwelling was its coolness. It was,
in fact, rather damp; the plastered walls bore a crop of green
mold, and a slimy moisture oozed through the black, dirty floor;
the rooms were large, but lighted by miserable little holes in
place of windows. The village is built on a clayey plateau, and the
ruinous houses are arranged round a large square, which is so
choked up with tangled bushes that it is quite impassable, the lazy
inhabitants having allowed the fine open space to relapse into
jungle. The stiff clayey eminence is worn into deep gullies which
slope towards the river, and the ascent from the port in rainy
weather is so slippery that one is obliged to crawl up to the
streets on all fours. A large tract of ground behind the place is
clear of forest, but this, as well as the streets and gardens, is
covered with a dense, tough carpet of shrubs, having the same wiry
nature as our common heath. Beneath its deceitful covering the soil
is always moist and soft, and in the wet season the whole is
converted into a glutinous mud swamp. There is a very pretty church
in one corner of the square, but in the rainy months of the year
(nine out of twelve) the place of worship is almost inaccessible to
the inhabitants on account of the mud, the only means of getting to
it being by hugging closely the walls and palings, and so advancing
sideways step by step.</p>

<p>I remained in this delectable place until the 25th of January,
1857. Fonte Boa, in addition to its other amenities, has the
reputation throughout the country of being the headquarters of
mosquitoes, and it fully deserves the title. They are more annoying
in the houses by day than by night, for they swarm in the dark and
damp rooms, keeping, in the daytime, near the floor, and settling
by half-dozens together on the legs. At night the calico tent is a
sufficient protection; but this is obliged to be folded every
morning, and in letting it down before sunset, great care is
required to prevent even one or two of the tormentors from stealing
in beneath, their insatiable thirst for blood, and pungent sting,
making these enough to spoil all comfort. In the forest the plague
is much worse; but the forest-mosquito belongs to a different
species from that of the town, being much larger, and having
transparent wings; it is a little cloud that one carries about
one&rsquo;s person every step on a woodland ramble, and their hum
is so loud that it prevents one hearing well the notes of birds.
The town-mosquito has opaque speckled wings, a less severe sting,
and a silent way of going to work; the inhabitants ought to be
thankful the big, noisy fellows never come out of the forest. In
compensation for the abundance of mosquitoes, Fonte Boa has no
piums; there was, therefore, some comfort outside one&rsquo;s door
in the daytime; the comfort, however, was lessened by their being
scarcely any room in front of the house to sit down or walk about,
for, on our side of the square, the causeway was only two feet
broad, and to step over the boundary, formed by a line of slippery
stems of palms, was to sink up to the knees in a sticky swamp.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding damp and mosquitoes, I had capital health, and
enjoyed myself much at Fonte Boa; swampy and weedy places being
generally more healthy than dry ones in the Amazons, probably owing
to the absence of great radiation of heat from the ground. The
forest was extremely rich and picturesque, although the soil was
everywhere clayey and cold, and broad pathways threaded it for many
a mile over hill and dale. In every hollow flowed a sparkling
brook, with perennial and crystal waters. The margins of these
streams were paradises of leafiness and verdure; the most striking
feature being the variety of ferns, with immense leaves, some
terrestrial, others climbing over trees, and two, at least,
arborescent. I saw here some of the largest trees I had yet seen;
there was one especially, a cedar, whose colossal trunk towered up
for more than a hundred feet, straight as an arrow; I never saw its
crown, which was lost to view, from below, beyond the crowd of
lesser trees which surrounded it. Birds and monkeys in this
glorious forest were very abundant; the bear-like Pithecia hirsuta
being the most remarkable of the monkeys, and the Umbrella
Chatterer and Curl-crested Toucans amongst the most beautiful of
the birds. The Indians and half-castes of the village have made
their little plantations, and built huts for summer residence on
the banks of the rivulets, and my rambles generally terminated at
one or other of these places. The people were always cheerful and
friendly, and seemed to be glad when I proposed to join them at
their meals, contributing the contents of my provision-bag to the
dinner, and squatting down amongst them on the mat.</p>

<p>The village was formerly a place of more importance than it now
is, a great number of Indians belonging to the most industrious
tribes, Shum&aacute;nas, Pass&eacute;s, and Camb&eacute;vas, having
settled on the site and adopted civilised habits, their industry
being directed by a few whites, who seem to have been men of humane
views as well as enterprising traders. One of these old employers,
Senhor Guerreiro, a well-educated Paraense, was still trading on
the Amazons when I left the country in 1859: he told me that forty
years previously Fonte Boa was a delightful place to live in. The
neighbourhood was then well cleared, and almost free from
mosquitoes, and the Indians were orderly, industrious, and happy.
What led to the ruin of the settlement was the arrival of several
Portuguese and Brazilian traders of a low class, who in their
eagerness for business taught the easy-going Indians all kinds of
trickery and immorality. They enticed the men and women away from
their old employers, and thus broke up the large establishments,
compelling the principals to take their capital to other places. At
the time of my visit there were few pure-blood Indians at Fonte
Boa, and no true whites. The inhabitants seemed to be nearly all
Mamelucos, and were a loose-living, rustic, plain-spoken and
ignorant set of people. There was no priest or schoolmaster within
150 miles, and had not been any for many years: the people seemed
to be almost without government of any kind, and yet crime and
deeds of violence appeared to be of very rare occurrence. The
principal man of the village, one Senhor Justo, was a big, coarse,
energetic fellow, sub-delegado of police, and the only tradesman
who owned a large vessel running directly between Fonte Boa and
Par&aacute;. He had recently built a large house, in the style of
middle-class dwellings of towns, namely, with brick floors and
tiled roof, the bricks and tiles having been brought from
Par&aacute;, 1500 miles distant, the nearest place where they are
manufactured in surplus. When Senhor Justo visited me he was much
struck with the engravings in a file of <i>Illustrated London
News</i>, which lay on my table. It was impossible to resist his
urgent entreaties to let him have some of them, &ldquo;to look
at,&rdquo; so one day he carried off a portion of the papers on
loan. A fortnight afterwards, on going to request him to return
them, I found the engravings had been cut out, and stuck all over
the newly whitewashed walls of his chamber, many of them upside
down. He thought a room thus decorated with foreign views would
increase his importance amongst his neighbours, and when I yielded
to his wish to keep them, was boundless in demonstrations of
gratitude, ending by shipping a boat-load of turtles for my use at
Ega.</p>

<p>These neglected and rude villagers still retained many religious
practices which former missionaries or priests had taught them. The
ceremony which they observed at Christmas, like that described as
practised by negroes in a former chapter, was very pleasing for its
simplicity, and for the heartiness with which it was conducted. The
church was opened, dried, and swept clean a few days before
Christmas Eve, and on the morning all the women and children of the
village were busy decorating it with festoons of leaves and wild
flowers. Towards midnight it was illuminated inside and out with
little oil lamps, made of clay, and the image of the &ldquo;menino
Deus,&rdquo; or Child-God, in its cradle, was placed below the
altar, which was lighted up with rows of wax candles, very lean
ones, but the best the poor people could afford. All the villagers
assembled soon afterwards, dressed in their best, the women with
flowers in their hair, and a few simple hymns, totally irrelevant
to the occasion, but probably the only ones known by them, were
sung kneeling; an old half-caste, with black-spotted face, leading
off the tunes. This finished, the congregation rose, and then
marched in single file up one side of the church and down the
other, singing together a very pretty marching chorus, and each
one, on reaching the little image, stooping to kiss the end of a
ribbon which was tied round its waist. Considering that the
ceremony was got up of their own free will, and at considerable
expense, I thought it spoke well for the good intentions and
simplicity of heart of these poor, neglected villagers.</p>

<p>I left Fonte Boa, for Ega, on the 25th of January, making the
passage by steamer, down the middle of the current, in sixteen
hours. The sight of the clean and neat little town, with its open
spaces, close-cropped grass, broad lake, and white sandy shores,
had a most exhilarating effect, after my trip into the wilder parts
of the country. The district between Ega and Loreto, the first
Peruvian village on the river, is, indeed, the most remote,
thinly-peopled, and barbarous of the whole line of the Amazons,
from ocean to ocean. Beyond Loreto, signs of civilisation, from the
side of the Pacific, begin to be numerous, and, from Ega downwards,
the improvement is felt from the side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p><i>September 5th, 1857.</i>&mdash;Again embarked on the <i>
Tabatinga</i>, this time for a longer excursion than the last,
namely to St. Paulo de Oliven&ccedil;a, a village higher up than
any I had yet visited, being 260 miles distant, in a straight line,
from Ega, or about 400 miles following the bends of the river.</p>

<p>The waters were now nearly at their lowest point; but this made
no difference to the rate of travelling, night or day. Several of
the Paran&aacute; mirims, or by-channels, which the steamer threads
in the season of full-water, to save a long circuit, were now dried
up, their empty beds looking like deep sandy ravines in the midst
of the thick forest. The large sand-islands, and miles of sandy
beach, were also uncovered, and these, with the swarms of large
aquatic birds; storks, herons, ducks, waders, and spoon-bills,
which lined their margins in certain places, made the river view
much more varied and animated than it is in the season of the
flood. Alligators of large size were common near the shores, lazily
floating, and heedless of the passing steamer. The passengers
amused themselves by shooting at them from the deck with a
double-barrelled rifle we had on board. The sign of a mortal hit
was the monster turning suddenly over, and remaining floating, with
its white belly upwards. Lieutenant Nunes wished to have one of the
dead animals on board, for the purpose of opening the abdomen, and,
if a male, extracting a part which is held in great estimation
amongst Brazilians as a &ldquo;remedio,&rdquo; charm or medicine.
The steamer was stopped, and a boat sent, with four strong men, to
embark the beast; the body, however, was found too heavy to be
lifted into the boat; so a rope was passed round it, and the
hideous creature towed alongside, and hoisted on deck by means of
the crane, which was rigged for the purpose. It had still some
sparks of life, and when the knife was applied, lashed its tail,
and opened its enormous jaws, sending the crowd of bystanders
flying in all directions. A blow with a hatchet on the crown of the
head gave him his quietus at last. The length of the animal was
fifteen feet; but this statement can give but an imperfect idea of
its immense bulk and weight. The numbers of turtles which were seen
swimming in quiet shoaly bays passed on the road, also gave us much
amusement. They were seen by dozens ahead, with their snouts
peering above the surface of the water; and, on the steamer
approaching, turning round to stare, but not losing confidence till
the vessel had nearly passed, when they appeared to be suddenly
smitten with distrust, diving like ducks under the stream.</p>

<p>We had on board, amongst our deck-passengers, a middle-aged
Indian, of the Jur&iacute; tribe; a short, thickset man, with
features resembling much those of the late Daniel O&rsquo;Connell.
His name was Carac&aacute;ra-&iacute; (Black Eagle), and his
countenance seemed permanently twisted into a grim smile, the
effect of which was heightened by the tattooed marks&mdash;a blue
rim to the mouth, with a diagonal pointed streak from each corner
towards the ear. He was dressed in European-style&mdash;black hat,
coat, and trousers&mdash;looking very uncomfortable in the dreadful
heat which, it is unnecessary to say, exists on board a steamer,
under a vertical sun, during mid-day hours. This Indian was a man
of steady resolution, ambitious and enterprising; very rare
qualities in the race to which he belonged, weakness of resolution
being one of the fundamental defects in the Indian character. He
was now on his return home to the banks of the Iss&aacute; from
Par&aacute;, whither he had been to sell a large quantity of
sarsaparilla that he had collected, with the help of a number of
Indians, whom he induces, or forces, to work for him. One naturally
feels inclined to know what ideas such a favourable specimen of the
Indian race may have acquired after so much experience amongst
civilised scenes. On conversing with our fellow-passenger, I was
greatly disappointed in him; he had seen nothing, and thought of
nothing, beyond what concerned his little trading speculation, his
mind being, evidently, what it had been before, with regard to all
higher subjects or general ideas, a blank. The dull, mean,
practical way of thinking of the Amazonian Indians, and the absence
of curiosity and speculative thought which seems to be organic or
confirmed in their character, although they are improvable to a
certain extent, make them, like commonplace people everywhere, most
uninteresting companions. Carac&aacute;-&iacute; disembarked at
Tunantins with his cargo, which consisted of a considerable number
of packages of European wares.</p>

<p>The river scenery about the mouth of the Japur&aacute; is
extremely grand, and was the subject of remark amongst the
passengers. Lieutenant Nunes gave it as his opinion, that there was
no diminution of width or grandeur in the mighty stream up to this
point, a distance of 1500 miles from the Atlantic; and yet we did
not here see the two shores of the river on both sides at once;
lines of islands, or tracts of alluvial land, having by-channels in
the rear, intercepting the view of the northern mainland, and
sometimes also of the southern. Beyond the Iss&aacute;, however,
the river becomes evidently narrower, being reduced to an average
width of about a mile; there were then no longer those magnificent
reaches, with blank horizons, which occur lower down. We had a dark
and rainy night after passing Tunantins, and the passengers were
all very uneasy on account of the speed at which we were
travelling, twelve miles an hour, with every plank vibrating with
the force of the engines. Many of them could not sleep, myself
amongst the number. At length, a little after midnight, a sudden
shout startled us: &ldquo;Back her!&rdquo; (English terms being
used in matters relating to steam-engines). The pilot instantly
sprung to the helm, and in a few moments we felt our paddle-box
brushing against the wall of forest into which we had nearly driven
headlong. Fortunately, the water was deep close up to the bank.
Early in the morning of the 10th of September we anchored in the
port of St. Paulo, after five days&rsquo; quick travelling from
Ega.</p>

<p>St. Paulo is built on a high hill, on the southern bank of the
river. The hill is formed of the same Tabatinga clay, which occurs
at intervals over the whole valley of the Amazons, but nowhere
rises to so great an elevation as here, the height being about 100
feet above the mean level of the river. The ascent from the port is
steep and slippery; steps and resting-places have been made to
lighten the fatigue of mounting, otherwise the village would be
almost inaccessible, especially to porters of luggage and cargo,
for there are no means of making a circuitous road of more moderate
slope, the hill being steep on all sides, and surrounded by dense
forests and swamps. The place contains about 500 inhabitants,
chiefly half-castes and Indians of the Tuc&uacute;na and
Coll&iacute;na tribes, who are very little improved from their
primitive state. The streets are narrow, and in rainy weather
inches deep in mud; many houses are of substantial structure, but
in a ruinous condition, and the place altogether presents the
appearance, like Fonte Boa, of having seen better days. Signs of
commerce, such as meet the eye at Ega, could scarcely be expected
in this remote spot, situate 1800 miles, or seven months&rsquo;
round voyage by sailing-vessels, from Par&aacute;, the nearest
market for produce. A very short experience showed that the
inhabitants were utterly debased, the few Portuguese and other
immigrants having, instead of promoting industry, adopted the lazy
mode of life of the Indians, spiced with the practice of a few
strong vices of their own introduction.</p>

<p>The head-man of the village, Senhor Antonio Ribeiro, half-white
half-Tuc&uacute;na, prepared a house for me on landing, and
introduced me to the principal people. The summit of the hill is
grassy table-land, of two or three hundred acres in extent. The
soil is not wholly clay, but partly sand and gravel; the village
itself, however, stands chiefly on clay, and the streets therefore
after heavy rains, become filled with muddy puddles. On damp nights
the chorus of frogs and toads which swarm in weedy back-yards
creates such a bewildering uproar that it is impossible to carry on
a conversation indoors except by shouting. My house was damper even
than the one I occupied at Fonte Boa, and this made it extremely
difficult to keep my collections from being spoilt by mould. But
the general humidity of the atmosphere in this part of the river
was evidently much greater than it is lower down; it appears to
increase gradually in ascending from the Atlantic to the Andes. It
was impossible at St. Paulo to keep salt for many days in a solid
state, which was not the case at Ega, when the baskets in which it
is contained were well wrapped in leaves. Six degrees further
westward, namely, at the foot of the Andes, the dampness of the
climate of the Amazonian forest region appears to reach its acme,
for Poeppig found at Chinchao that the most refined sugar, in a few
days, dissolved into syrup, and the best gunpowder became liquid,
even when enclosed in canisters. At St. Paulo refined sugar kept
pretty well in tin boxes, and I had no difficulty in keeping my
gunpowder dry in canisters, although a gun loaded overnight could
very seldom be fired off in the morning.</p>

<p>The principal residents at St. Paulo were the priest, a white
from Par&aacute;, who spent his days and most of his nights in
gambling and rum-drinking, corrupting the young fellows and setting
the vilest example to the Indians; the sub-delegado, an upright,
open-hearted, and loyal negro, whom I have before mentioned, Senhor
Jos&eacute; Patricio; the Juiz de Paz, a half-caste named Geraldo,
and lastly, Senhor Antonio Ribeiro, who was Director of the
Indians. Geraldo and Ribeiro were my near neighbours, but they took
offence at me after the first few days, because I would not join
them in their drinking bouts, which took place about every third
day. They used to begin early in the morning with Casha&ccedil;a
mixed with grated ginger, a powerful drink, which used to excite
them almost to madness. Neighbour Geraldo, after these morning
potations, used to station himself opposite my house and rave about
foreigners, gesticulating in a threatening manner towards me by the
hour. After becoming sober in the evening, he usually came to offer
me the humblest apologies, driven to it, I believe, by his wife, he
himself being quite unconscious of this breach of good manners. The
wives of the St. Paulo worthies, however, were generally as bad as
their husbands; nearly all the women being hard drinkers, and
corrupt to the last degree. Wife-beating naturally flourished under
such a state of things. I found it always best to lock myself
indoors after sunset, and take no notice of the thumps and screams
which used to rouse the village in different quarters throughout
the night, especially at festival times.</p>

<p>The only companionable man I found in the place, except
Jos&eacute; Patricio, who was absent most part of the time, was the
negro tailor of the village, a tall, thin, grave young man, named
Mestre Chico (Master Frank), whose acquaintance I had made at
Par&aacute; several years previously. He was a free negro by birth,
but had had the advantage of kind treatment in his younger days,
having been brought up by a humane and sensible man, one Captain
Basilio, of Pernambuco, his padrinho, or godfather. He neither
drank, smoked, nor gambled, and was thoroughly disgusted at the
depravity of all classes in this wretched little settlement, which
he intended to quit as soon as possible. When he visited me at
night he used to knock at my shutters in a manner we had agreed on,
it being necessary to guard against admitting drunken neighbours,
and we then spent the long evenings most pleasantly, working and
conversing. His manners were courteous, and his talk well worth
listening to, for the shrewdness and good sense of his remarks. I
first met Mestre Chico at the house of an old negress of
Par&aacute;, Tia Rufina (Aunt Rufina), who used to take charge of
my goods when I was absent on a voyage, and this affords me an
opportunity of giving a few further instances of the excellent
qualities of free negroes in a country where they are not wholly
condemned to a degrading position by the pride or selfishness of
the white race. This old woman was born a slave, but, like many
others in the large towns of Brazil, she had been allowed to trade
on her own account, as market-woman, paying a fixed sum daily to
her owner, and keeping for herself all her surplus gains. In a few
years she had saved sufficient money to purchase her freedom, and
that of her grown-up son. This done, the old lady continued to
strive until she had earned enough to buy the house in which she
lived, a considerable property situated in one of the principal
streets. When I returned from the interior, after seven
years&rsquo; absence from Par&aacute;, I found she was still
advancing in prosperity, entirely through her own exertions (being
a widow) and those of her son, who continued, with the most regular
industry, his trade as blacksmith, and was now building a number of
small houses on a piece of unoccupied land attached to her
property. I found these and many other free negroes most
trustworthy people, and admired the constancy of their friendships
and the gentleness and cheerfulness of their manners towards each
other. They showed great disinterestedness in their dealings with
me, doing me many a piece of service without a hint at
remuneration; but this may have been partly due to the name of
Englishman, the knowledge of our national generosity towards the
African race being spread far and wide amongst the Brazilian
negroes.</p>

<p>I remained at St. Paulo five months; five years would not have
been sufficient to exhaust the treasures of its neighbourhood in
Zoology and Botany. Although now a forest-rambler of ten
years&rsquo; experience, the beautiful forest which surrounds this
settlement gave me as much enjoyment as if I had only just landed
for the first time in a tropical country. The plateau on which the
village is built extends on one side nearly a mile into the forest,
but on the other side the descent into the lowland begins close to
the streets; the hill sloping abruptly towards a boggy meadow
surrounded by woods, through which a narrow winding path continues
the slope down to a cool shady glen, with a brook of icy-cold water
flowing at the bottom. At mid-day the vertical sun penetrates into
the gloomy depths of this romantic spot, lighting up the leafy
banks of the rivulet and its clean sandy margins, where numbers of
scarlet, green, and black tanagers and brightly-coloured
butterflies sport about in the stray beams. Sparkling brooks, large
and small, traverse the glorious forest in almost every direction,
and one is constantly meeting, whilst rambling through the
thickets, with trickling rills and bubbling springs, so
well-provided is the country with moisture. Some of the rivulets
flow over a sandy and pebbly bed, and the banks of all are clothed
with the most magnificent vegetation conceivable. I had the almost
daily habit, in my solitary walks, of resting on the clean banks of
these swift-flowing streams, and bathing for an hour at a time in
their bracing waters; hours which now remain amongst my most
pleasant memories. The broad forest roads continue, as I was told,
a distance of several days&rsquo; journey into the interior, which
is peopled by Tuc&uacute;nas and other Indians, living in scattered
houses and villages nearly in their primitive state, the nearest
village lying about six miles from St. Paulo. The banks of all the
streams are dotted with palm-thatched dwellings of Tuc&uacute;nas,
all half-buried in the leafy wilderness, the scattered families
having chosen the coolest and shadiest nooks for their abodes.</p>

<p>I frequently heard in the neighbourhood of these huts, the
&ldquo;realejo&rdquo; or organ bird (Cyphorhinus cantans), the most
remarkable songster, by far, of the Amazonian forests. When its
singular notes strike the ear for the first time, the impression
cannot be resisted that they are produced by a human voice. Some
musical boy must be gathering fruit in the thickets, and is singing
a few notes to cheer himself. The tones become more fluty and
plaintive; they are now those of a flageolet, and notwithstanding
the utter impossibility of the thing, one is for the moment
convinced that somebody is playing that instrument. No bird is to
be seen, however closely the surrounding trees and bushes may be
scanned, and yet the voice seems to come from the thicket close to
one&rsquo;s ears. The ending of the song is rather disappointing.
It begins with a few very slow and mellow notes, following each
other like the commencement of an air; one listens expecting to
hear a complete strain, but an abrupt pause occurs, and then the
song breaks down, finishing with a number of clicking unmusical
sounds like a piping barrel organ out of wind and tune. I never
heard the bird on the Lower Amazon, and very rarely heard it even
at Ega; it is the only songster which makes an impression on the
natives, who sometimes rest their paddles whilst travelling in
their small canoes, along the shady by-streams, as if struck by the
mysterious sounds.</p>

<br>
<p>The Tuc&uacute;na Indians are a tribe resembling much the
Shum&aacute;nas, Pass&eacute;s, Jur&iacute;s, and Mauh&eacute;s in
their physical appearance and customs. They lead, like those
tribes, a settled agricultural life, each horde obeying a chief of
more or less influence, according to his energy and ambition, and
possessing its paj&eacute; or medicine-man who fosters its
superstitions; but, they are much more idle and debauched than
other Indians belonging to the superior tribes. They are not so
warlike and loyal as the Munduruc&uacute;s, although resembling
them in many respects, nor have they the slender figures, dignified
mien, and gentle disposition of the Pass&eacute;s; there are,
however, no trenchant points of difference to distinguish them from
these highest of all the tribes. Both men and women are tattooed,
the pattern being sometimes a scroll on each cheek, but generally
rows of short straight lines on the face. Most of the older people
wear bracelets, anklets, and garters of tapir-hide or tough bark;
in their homes they wear no other dress except on festival days,
when they ornament themselves with feathers or masked cloaks made
of the inner bark of a tree. They were very shy when I made my
first visits to their habitations in the forest, all scampering off
to the thicket when I approached, but on subsequent days they
became more familiar, and I found them a harmless, good-natured
people.</p>

<p>A great part of the horde living at the first Maloca or village
dwell in a common habitation, a large oblong hut built and arranged
inside with such a disregard of all symmetry that it appeared as
though constructed by a number of hands, each working
independently, stretching a rafter or fitting in a piece of thatch,
without reference to what his fellow-labourers were doing. The
walls as well as the roof are covered with thatch of palm leaves;
each piece consisting of leaflets plaited and attached in a row to
a lath many feet in length. Strong upright posts support the roof,
hammocks being slung between them, leaving a free space for passage
and for fires in the middle, and on one side is an elevated stage
(<i>girao</i>) overhead, formed of split palm-stems. The
Tuc&uacute;nas excel over most of the other tribes in the
manufacture of pottery. They make broad-mouthed jars for Tucupi
sauce, cays&uacute;ma or mandioca beer, capable of holding twenty
or more gallons, ornamenting them outside with crossed diagonal
streaks of various colours. These jars, with cooking-pots, smaller
jars for holding water, blow-guns, quivers, matiri bags<sup><a
href="#1">2</a></sup> full of small articles, baskets, skins of
animals, and so forth, form the principal part of the furniture of
their huts both large and small. The dead bodies of their chiefs
are interred, the knees doubled up, in large jars under the floors
of their huts.</p>

<p>The semi-religious dances and drinking bouts usual amongst the
settled tribes of Amazonian Indians are indulged in to greater
excess by the Tuc&uacute;nas than they are by most other tribes.
The Jurupar&iacute; or Demon is the only superior being they have
any conception of, and his name is mixed up with all their
ceremonies, but it is difficult to ascertain what they consider to
be his attributes. He seems to be believed in simply as a
mischievous imp, who is at the bottom of all those mishaps of their
daily life, the causes of which are not very immediate or obvious
to their dull understandings. It is vain to try to get information
out of a Tuc&uacute;na on this subject; they affect great mystery
when the name is mentioned, and give very confused answers to
questions: it was clear, however, that the idea of a spirit as a
beneficent God or Creator had not entered the minds of these
Indians. There is great similarity in all their ceremonies and
mummeries, whether the object is a wedding, the celebration of the
feast of fruits, the plucking of the hair from the heads of their
children, or a holiday got up simply out of a love of dissipation.
Some of the tribe on these occasions deck themselves with the
bright-coloured feathers of parrots and macaws. The chief wears a
headdress or cap made by fixing the breast-feathers of the Toucan
on a web of Bromelia twine, with erect tail plumes of macaws rising
from the crown. The cinctures of the arms and legs are also then
ornamented with bunches of feathers. Others wear masked dresses;
these are long cloaks reaching below the knee, and made of the
thick whitish-coloured inner bark of a tree, the fibres of which
are interlaced in so regular a manner that the material looks like
artificial cloth. The cloak covers the head; two holes are cut out
for the eyes, a large round piece of the cloth stretched on a rim
of flexible wood is stitched on each side to represent ears, and
the features are painted in exaggerated style with yellow, red, and
black streaks. The dresses are sewn into the proper shapes with
thread made of the inner bark of the Uaiss&iacute;ma tree.
Sometimes grotesque head-dresses, representing monkeys&rsquo; busts
or heads of other animals, made by stretching cloth or skin over a
basketwork frame, are worn at these holidays. The biggest and
ugliest mask represents the Jurupar&iacute;. In these festival
habiliments the Tuc&uacute;nas go through their monotonous see-saw
and stamping dances accompanied by singing and drumming, and keep
up the sport often for three or four days and nights in succession,
drinking enormous quantities of caysuma, smoking tobacco, and
snuffing paric&aacute; powder.</p>

"Masked-dance and wedding-feast of Tuc&uacute;na Indians.">
</center>

<p>I could not learn that there was any deep symbolical meaning in
these masked dances, or that they commemorated any past event in
the history of the tribe. Some of them seem vaguely intended as a
propitiation of the Jurupar&iacute;, but the masker who represents
the demon sometimes gets drunk along with the rest, and is not
treated with any reverence. From all I could make out, these
Indians preserve no memory of events going beyond the times of
their fathers or grandfathers. Almost every joyful event is made
the occasion of a festiva: weddings amongst the best. A young man
who wishes to wed a Tuc&uacute;na girl has to demand her hand of
her parents, who arrange the rest of the affair, and fix a day for
the marriage ceremony. A wedding which took place in the Christmas
week whilst I was at St. Paulo was kept up with great spirit for
three or four days, flagging during the heats of mid-day, but
renewing itself with increased vigour every evening. During the
whole time the bride, decked out with feather ornaments, was under
the charge of the older squaws whose business seemed to be,
sedulously, to keep the bridegroom at a safe distance until the end
of the dreary period of dancing and boosing. The Tuc&uacute;nas
have the singular custom, in common with the Coll&iacute;nas and
Mauh&eacute;s, of treating their young girls, on their showing the
first signs of womanhood, as if they had committed some crime. They
are sent up to the girao under the smoky and filthy roof, and kept
there on very meagre diet, sometimes for a whole month. I heard of
one poor girl dying under this treatment.</p>

<p>The only other tribe of this neighbourhood concerning which I
obtained any information were the Majer&oacute;nas, whose territory
embraces several hundred miles of the western bank of the river
Jauar&iacute;, an affluent of the Solimoens, 120 miles beyond St.
Paulo. These are a fierce, indomitable, and hostile people, like
the Ar&aacute;ras of the river Madeira; they are also cannibals.
The navigation of the Jauaar&iacute; is rendered impossible on
account of the Majer&oacute;nas lying in wait on its banks to
intercept and murder all travellers, especially whites.</p>

<p>Four months before my arrival at St. Paulo, two young
half-castes (nearly white) of the village went to trade on the
Jauaar&iacute;; the Majer&oacute;nas having shown signs of abating
their hostility for a year or two previously. They had not been
long gone, when their canoe returned with the news that the two
young fellows had been shot with arrows, roasted, and eaten by the
savages. Jose Patricio, with his usual activity in the cause of law
and order, despatched a party of armed men of the National Guard to
the place to make inquiries, and, if the murder should appear to be
unprovoked, to retaliate. When they reached the settlement of the
horde who had eaten the two men, it was found evacuated, with the
exception of one girl, who had been in the woods when the rest of
her people had taken flight, and whom the guards brought with them
to St. Paulo. It was gathered from her, and from other Indians on
the Jauaar&iacute;, that the young men had brought their fate on
themselves through improper conduct towards the Majer&oacute;na
women. The girl, on arriving at St. Paulo, was taken care of by
Senhor Jos&eacute; Patricio, baptised under the name of Maria, and
taught Portuguese. I saw a good deal of her, for my friend sent her
daily to my house to fill the water-jars, make the fire, and so
forth. I also gained her goodwill by extracting the grub of an
&OElig;strus fly from her back, and thus cured her of a painful
tumour. She was decidedly the best-humoured and, to all appearance,
the kindest-hearted specimen of her race I had yet seen. She was
tall and very stout; in colour much lighter than the ordinary
Indian tint, and her ways altogether were more like those of a
careless, laughing country wench, such as might be met with any day
amongst the labouring class in villages in our own country, than a
cannibal. I heard this artless maiden relate, in the coolest manner
possible, how she ate a portion of the bodies of the young men whom
her tribe had roasted. But what increased greatly the incongruity
of this business, the young widow of one of the victims, a
neighbour of mine, happened to be present during the narrative, and
showed her interest in it by laughing at the broken Portuguese in
which the girl related the horrible story.</p>

<br>
<p>In the fourth month of my sojourn at St. Paulo I had a serious
illness, an attack of the &ldquo;sizoens,&rdquo; or ague of the
country, which, as it left me with shattered health and damped
enthusiasm, led to my abandoning the plan I had formed of
proceeding to the Peruvian towns of Pebas and Moyobamba, 250 and
600 miles further west, and so completing the examination of the
Natural History of the Amazonian plains up to the foot of the
Andes. I made a very large collection at St. Paulo, and employed a
collector at Tabatinga and on the banks of the Jauaar&iacute; for
several months, so that I acquired a very fair knowledge altogether
of the productions of the country bordering the Amazons to the end
of the Brazilian territory, a distance of 1900 miles from the
Atlantic at the mouth of the Par&aacute;; but beyond the Peruvian
boundary I found now I should be unable to go. My ague seemed to be
the culmination of a gradual deterioration of health, which had
been going on for several years. I had exposed myself too much in
the sun, working to the utmost of my strength six days a week, and
had suffered much, besides, from bad and insufficient food. The
ague did not exist at St. Paulo but the foul and humid state of the
village was, perhaps, sufficient to produce ague in a person much
weakened from other causes. The country bordering the shores of the
Solimoens is healthy throughout; some endemic diseases certainly
exist, but these are not of a fatal nature, and the epidemics which
desolated the Lower Amazons from Par&aacute; to the Rio Negro,
between the years 1850 and 1856, had never reached this favoured
land. Ague is known only on the banks of those tributary streams
which have dark-coloured water.</p>

<p>I always carried a stock of medicines with me; and a small phial
of quinine, which I had bought at Par&aacute; in 1851, but never
yet had use for, now came in very useful. I took for each dose as
much as would lie on the tip of a penknife-blade, mixing it with
warm camomile tea. The first few days after my first attack I could
not stir, and was delirious during the paroxysms of fever; but the
worst being over, I made an effort to rouse myself, knowing that
incurable disorders of the liver and spleen follow ague in this
country if the feeling of lassitude is too much indulged. So every
morning I shouldered my gun or insect-net, and went my usual walk
in the forest. The fit of shivering very often seized me before I
got home, and I then used to stand still and brave it out. When the
steamer ascended in January, 1858, Lieutenant Nunes was shocked to
see me so much shattered, and recommended me strongly to return at
once to Ega. I took his advice, and embarked with him, when he
touched at St. Paulo on his downward voyage, on the 2nd of
February. I still hoped to be able to turn my face westward again,
to gather the yet unseen treasures of the marvellous countries
lying between Tabatinga and the slopes of the Andes; but although,
after a short rest in Ega, the ague left me, my general health
remained in a state too weak to justify the undertaking of further
journeys. At length I left Ega, on the 3rd of February, 1859, <i>en
route</i> for England.</p>

<p>I arrived at Par&aacute; on the 17th of March, after an absence
in the interior of seven years and a half. My old friends, English,
American, and Brazilian, scarcely knew me again, but all gave me a
very warm welcome, especially Mr. G. R. Brocklehurst (of the firm
of R. Singlehurst and Co., the chief foreign merchants, who had
been my correspondents), who received me into his house, and
treated me with the utmost kindness. I was rather surprised at the
warm appreciation shown by many of the principal people of my
labours; but, in fact, the interior of the country is still the
&ldquo;sertao&rdquo; (wilderness)&mdash;a <i>terra incognita</i> to
most residents of the seaport&mdash;and a man who had spent seven
years and a half in exploring it solely with scientific aims was
somewhat of a curiosity. I found Par&aacute; greatly changed and
improved. It was no longer the weedy, ruinous, village-looking
place that it appeared to be when I first knew it in 1848. The
population had been increased to 20,000 by an influx of Portuguese,
Madeiran, and German immigrants, and for many years past the
provincial government had spent their considerable surplus revenue
in beautifying the city. The streets, formerly unpaved or strewn
with loose stones and sand, were now laid with concrete in a most
complete manner, all the projecting masonry of the
irregularly-built houses had been cleared away, and the buildings
made more uniform. Most of the dilapidated houses were replaced by
handsome new edifices, having long and elegant balconies fronting
the first floors, at an elevation of several feet above the
roadway. The large, swampy squares had been drained, weeded, and
planted with rows of almond and casuarina trees, so that they were
now a great ornament to the city, instead of an eyesore as they
formerly were. My old favourite road, the Monguba avenue, had been
renovated and joined to many other magnificent rides lined with
trees, which in a very few years had grown to a height sufficient
to afford agreeable shade; one of these, the Estrada de Sao
Jos&eacute;, had been planted with cocoa-nut palms. Sixty public
vehicles, light cabriolets (some of them built in Par&aacute;), now
plied in the streets, increasing much the animation of the
beautified squares, streets, and avenues.</p>

<p>I found also the habits of the people considerably changed. Many
of the old religious holidays had declined in importance, and given
way to secular amusements; social parties, balls, music, billiards,
and so forth. There was quite as much pleasure seeking as formerly,
but it was turned in a more rational direction, and the Paraenses
seemed now to copy rather the customs of the northern nations of
Europe than those of the mother country, Portugal. I was glad to
see several new booksellers&rsquo; shops, and also a fine edifice
devoted to a reading-room supplied with periodicals, globes, and
maps, and a circulating library. There were now many
printing-offices, and four daily newspapers. The health of the
place had greatly improved since 1850, the year of the yellow
fever, and Par&aacute; was now considered no longer dangerous to
newcomers.</p>

<p>So much for the improvements visible in the place, and now for
the dark side of the picture. The expenses of living had increased
about fourfold, a natural consequence of the demand for labour and
for native products of all kinds having augmented in greater ratio
than the supply, through large arrivals of non-productive
residents, and considerable importations of money on account of the
steamboat company and foreign merchants. Par&aacute;, in 1848, was
one of the cheapest places of residence on the American continent;
it was now one of the dearest. Imported articles of food, clothing,
and furniture were mostly cheaper, although charged with duties
varying from 18 to 80 per cent, besides high freights and large
profits, than those produced in the neighbourhood. Salt codfish was
twopence per pound cheaper than the vile salt pirarucu of the
country. Oranges, which could formerly be had almost gratis, were
now sold in the streets at the rate of three for a penny; large
bananas were a penny each; tomatoes were from two to three pence
each, and all other fruits in this fruit-producing country had
advanced in like proportion. Mandioca-meal, the bread of the
country, had become so scarce and dear and bad that the poorer
classes of natives suffered famine, and all who could afford it
were obliged to eat wheaten bread at fourpence to fivepence per
pound, made from American flour, 1200 barrels of which were
consumed monthly; this was now, therefore, a very serious item of
daily expense to all but the most wealthy. House rent was most
exorbitant; a miserable little place of two rooms, without fixtures
or conveniences of any kind, having simply blank walls&rsquo; cost
at the rate of &pound;18 sterling a year. Lastly, the hire of
servants was beyond the means of all persons in moderate
circumstances; a lazy cook or porter could not be had for less than
three or four shillings a day, besides his board and what he could
steal. It cost me half-a-crown for the hire of a small boat and one
man to disembark from the steamer, a distance of 100 yards.</p>

<p>In rambling over my old ground in the forests of the
neighbourhood, I found great changes had taken place&mdash;to me,
changes for the worse. The mantle of shrubs, bushes, and creeping
plants which formerly, when the suburbs were undisturbed by axe or
spade, had been left free to arrange itself in rich, full, and
smooth sheets and masses over the forest borders, had been nearly
all cut away, and troops of labourers were still employed cutting
ugly muddy roads for carts and cattle, through the once clean and
lonely woods. Houses and mills had been erected on the borders of
these new roads. The noble forest-trees had been cut down, and
their naked, half-burnt stems remained in the midst of ashes, muddy
puddles, and heaps of broken branches. I was obliged to hire a
negro boy to show me the way to my favourite path near Una, which I
have described in the second chapter of this narrative; the new
clearings having quite obliterated the old forest roads. Only a few
acres of the glorious forest near Una now remained in their natural
state. On the other side of the city, near the old road to the rice
mills, several scores of woodsmen were employed under Government,
in cutting a broad carriage-road through the forest to Maranham,
the capital of the neighbouring province, distant 250 miles from
Par&aacute;, and this had entirely destroyed the solitude of the
grand old forest path. In the course of a few years, however, a new
growth of creepers will cover the naked tree-trunks on the borders
of this new road, and luxuriant shrubs form a green fringe to the
path: it will then become as beautiful a woodland road as the old
one was. A naturalist will have, henceforward, to go farther from
the city to find the glorious forest scenery which lay so near in
1848, and work much more laboriously than was formerly needed to
make the large collections which Mr. Wallace and I succeeded in
doing in the neighbourhood of Par&aacute;.</p>

<p><i>June 2, 1859.</i>&mdash;At length, on the 2nd of June, I left
Par&aacute;, probably forever; embarking in a North American
trading-vessel, the <i>Frederick Demming</i>, for New York, the
United States route being the quickest as well as the pleasantest
way of reaching England. My extensive private collections were
divided into three portions and sent by three separate ships, to
lessen the risk of loss of the whole. On the evening of the 3rd of
June, I took a last view of the glorious forest for which I had so
much love, and to explore which I had devoted so many years. The
saddest hours I ever recollect to have spent were those of the
succeeding night when, the Mameluco pilot having left us free of
the shoals and out of sight of land though within the mouth of the
river at anchor waiting for the wind, I felt that the last link
which connected me with the land of so many pleasing recollections
was broken. The Paraenses, who are fully aware of the
attractiveness of their country, have an alliterative proverb,
&ldquo;Quem vai para (o) Par&aacute; para,&rdquo; &ldquo;He who
goes to Par&aacute; stops there,&rdquo; and I had often thought I
should myself have been added to the list of examples. The desire,
however, of seeing again my parents and enjoying once more the rich
pleasures of intellectual society, had succeeded in overcoming the
attractions of a region which may be fittingly called a
Naturalist&rsquo;s Paradise. During this last night on the
Par&aacute; river, a crowd of unusual thoughts occupied my mind.
Recollections of English climate, scenery, and modes of life came
to me with a vividness I had never before experienced, during the
eleven years of my absence. Pictures of startling clearness rose up
of the gloomy winters, the long grey twilights, murky atmosphere,
elongated shadows, chilly springs, and sloppy summers; of factory
chimneys and crowds of grimy operatives, rung to work in early
morning by factory bells; of union workhouses, confined rooms,
artificial cares, and slavish conventionalities. To live again
amidst these dull scenes, I was quitting a country of perpetual
summer, where my life had been spent like that of three-fourths of
the people in gipsy fashion, on the endless streams or in the
boundless forests. I was leaving the equator, where the
well-balanced forces of Nature maintained a land-surface and
climate that seemed to be typical of mundane order and beauty, to
sail towards the North Pole, where lay my home under crepuscular
skies somewhere about fifty-two degrees of latitude. It was natural
to feel a little dismayed at the prospect of so great a change; but
now, after three years of renewed experience of England, I find how
incomparably superior is civilised life, where feelings, tastes,
and intellect find abundant nourishment, to the spiritual sterility
of half-savage existence, even though it be passed in the garden of
Eden. What has struck me powerfully is the immeasurably greater
diversity and interest of human character and social conditions in
a single civilised nation, than in equatorial South America, where
three distinct races of man live together. The superiority of the
bleak north to tropical regions, however, is only in their social
aspect, for I hold to the opinion that, although humanity can reach
an advanced state of culture only by battling with the inclemencies
of nature in high latitudes, it is under the equator alone that the
perfect race of the future will attain to complete fruition of
man&rsquo;s beautiful heritage, the earth.</p>

<p>The following day, having no wind, we drifted out of the mouth
of the Par&aacute; with the current of fresh water that is poured
from the mouth of the river, and in twenty-four hours advanced in
this way seventy miles on our road. On the 6th of June, when in
7&deg; 55' N. lat. and 52&deg; 30' W. long., and therefore about
400 miles from the mouth of the main Amazons, we passed numerous
patches of floating grass mingled with tree-trunks and withered
foliage. Amongst these masses I espied many fruits of that
peculiarly Amazonian tree the Ubuss&uacute; palm; this was the last
I saw of the Great River.</p>

ability of these Indians. The Tuc&uacute;nas also possess the art
of skinning and stuffing birds, the handsome kinds of which they
sell in great numbers to passing travellers.</p>

of the official release dates, leaving time for better editing.
Please be encouraged to tell us about any error or corrections,
even years after the official publication date.

Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.   Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks!
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users.
