<br>


<p class="first">I must now take the reader from the picturesque,
hilly country of the Tapajos, and its dark, streamless waters, to
the boundless wooded plains, and yellow turbid current of the Upper
Amazons or Solimoens. I will resume the narrative of my first
voyage up the river, which was interrupted at the Barra of the Rio
Negro in the seventh chapter, to make way for the description of
Santarem and its neighbourhood.</p>

<p>I embarked at Barra on the 26th of March, 1850, three years
before steamers were introduced on the upper river, in a cuberta
which was returning to Ega, the first and only town of any
importance in the vast solitudes of the Solimoens, from Santarem,
whither it had been sent, with a cargo of turtle oil in earthenware
jars. The owner, an old white-haired Portuguese trader of Ega named
Daniel Cardozo, was then at Barra attending the assizes as juryman,
a public duty performed without remuneration, which took him six
weeks away from his business. He was about to leave Barra himself,
in a small boat, and recommended me to send forward my heavy
baggage in the cuberta and make the journey with him. He would
reach Ega, 370 miles distant from Barra, in twelve or fourteen
days; whilst the large vessel would be thirty or forty days on the
road. I preferred, however, to go in company with my luggage,
looking forward to the many opportunities I should have of landing
and making collections on the banks of the river.</p>

<p>I shipped the collections made between Par&aacute; and the Rio
Negro in a large cutter which was about descending to the capital,
and after a heavy day&rsquo;s work got all my chests aboard the Ega
canoe by eight o&rsquo;clock at night. The Indians were then all
embarked, one of them being brought dead drunk by his companions,
and laid to sober himself all night on the wet boards of the
tombadilha. The cabo, a spirited young white, named Estulano Alves
Carneiro, who has since risen to be a distinguished citizen of the
new province of the Upper Amazons, soon after gave orders to get up
the anchor. The men took to the oars, and in a few hours we crossed
the broad mouth of the Rio Negro; the night being clear, calm, and
starlit, and the surface of the inky waters smooth as a lake.</p>

<br>
<p>When I awoke the next morning, we were progressing by espia
along the left bank of the Solimoens. The rainy season had now set
in over the region through which the great river flows; the
sand-banks and all the lower lands were already under water, and
the tearing current, two or three miles in breadth, bore along a
continuous line of uprooted trees and islets of floating plants.
The prospect was most melancholy; no sound was heard but the dull
murmur of the waters; the coast along which we travelled all day
was encumbered every step of the way with fallen trees, some of
which quivered in the currents which set around projecting points
of land. Our old pest, the Mot&uacute;ca, began to torment us as
soon as the sun gained power in the morning. White egrets were
plentiful at the edge of the water, and humming-birds, in some
places, were whirring about the flowers overhead. The desolate
appearance of the landscape increased after sunset, when the moon
rose in mist.</p>

<p>This upper river, the Alto-Amazonas, or Solimoens, is always
spoken of by the Brazilians as a distinct stream. This is partly
owing, as before remarked, to the direction it seems to take at the
fork of the Rio Negro; the inhabitants of the country, from their
partial knowledge, not being able to comprehend the whole river
system in one view. It has, however, many peculiarities to
distinguish it from the lower course of the river. The trade-wind,
or sea-breeze, which reaches, in the height of the dry season, as
far as the mouth of the Rio Negro, 900 or 1000 miles from the
Atlantic, never blows on the upper river. The atmosphere is
therefore more stagnant and sultry, and the winds that do prevail
are of irregular direction and short duration. A great part of the
land on the borders of the Lower Amazons is hilly; there are
extensive campos, or open plains, and long stretches of sandy soil
clothed with thinner forests. The climate, in consequence, is
comparatively dry many months in succession during the fine season
passing without rain. All this is changed on the Solimoens. A
fortnight of clear sunny weather is a rarity: the whole region
through which the river and its affluents flow, after leaving the
easternmost ridges of the Andes, which P&ouml;ppig describes as
rising like a wall from the level country, 240 miles from the
Pacific, is a vast plain, about 1000 miles in length, and 500 or
600 in breadth, covered with one uniform, lofty, impervious, and
humid forest. The soil is nowhere sandy, but always either a stiff
clay, alluvium, or vegetable mold, which the latter, in many
places, is seen in water-worn sections of the river banks to be
twenty or thirty feet in depth. With such a soil and climate, the
luxuriance of vegetation, and the abundance and beauty of animal
forms which are already so great in the region nearer the Atlantic,
increase on the upper river. The fruits, both wild and cultivated,
common to the two sections of the country, reach a progressively
larger size in advancing westward, and some trees, which blossom
only once a year at Par&aacute; and Santarem, yield flower and
fruit all the year round at Ega. The climate is healthy, although
one lives here as in a permanent vapour bath. I must not, however,
give here a lengthy description of the region whilst we are yet on
its threshold. I resided and travelled on the Solimoens altogether
for four years and a half. The country on its borders is a
magnificent wilderness where civilised man, as yet, has scarcely
obtained a footing; the cultivated ground from the Rio Negro to the
Andes amounting only to a few score acres. Man, indeed, in any
condition, from his small numbers, makes but an insignificant
figure in these vast solitudes. It may be mentioned that the
Solimoens is 2130 miles in length, if we reckon from the source of
what is usually considered the main stream (Lake Lauricocha, near
Lima); but 2500 miles by the route of the Ucayali, the most
considerable and practicable fork of the upper part of the river.
It is navigable at all seasons by large steamers for upwards of
1400 miles from the mouth of the Rio Negro.</p>

<br>
<p>On the 28th we passed the mouth of Ariau&uuml;, a narrow inlet
which communicates with the Rio Negro, emerging in front of Barra.
Our vessel was nearly drawn into this by the violent current which
set from the Solimoens. The towing-cable was lashed to a strong
tree about thirty yards ahead, and it took the whole strength of
crew and passengers to pull across. We passed the Guariba, a second
channel connecting the two rivers, on the 30th, and on the 31st
sailed past a straggling settlement called
Manac&aacute;pur&uacute;, situated on a high, rocky bank. Many
citizens of Barra have <i>sitios</i>, or country-houses, in this
place, although it is eighty miles distant from the town by the
nearest road. Beyond Manac&aacute;pur&uacute; all traces of high
land cease; both shores of the river, henceforward for many hundred
miles, are flat, except in places where the Tabatinga formation
appears in clayey elevations of from twenty to forty feet above the
line of highest water. The country is so completely destitute of
rocky or gravelly beds that not a pebble is seen during many
weeks&rsquo; journey. Our voyage was now very monotonous. After
leaving the last house at Manac&aacute;pur&uacute;, we travelled
nineteen days without seeing a human habitation, the few settlers
being located on the banks of inlets or lakes some distance from
the shores of the main river. We met only one vessel during the
whole of the time, and this did not come within hail, as it was
drifting down in the middle of the current in a broad part of the
river, two miles from the bank along which we were laboriously
warping our course upwards.</p>

<p>After the first two or three days we fell into a regular way of
life on board. Our crew was composed of ten Indians of the
Cuc&aacute;ma nation, whose native country is a portion of the
borders of the upper river in the neighbourhood of Nauta, in Peru.
The Cuc&aacute;mas speak the Tup&iacute; language, using, however,
a harsher accent than is common amongst the semi-civilised Indians
from Ega downwards. They are a shrewd, hard-working people, and are
the only Indians who willingly, and in a body, engage themselves to
navigate the canoes of traders. The pilot, a steady and faithful
fellow named Vicente, told me that he and his companions had now
been fifteen months absent from their wives and families, and that
on arriving at Ega they intended to take the first chance of a
passage to Nauta. There was nothing in the appearance of these men
to distinguish them from canoemen in general. Some were tall and
well built, others had squat figures with broad shoulders and
excessively thick arms and legs. No two of them were at all similar
in the shape of the head: Vicente had an oval visage, with fine
regular features, whilst a little dumpy fellow, the wag of the
party, was quite a Mongolian in breadth and prominence of cheek,
spread of nostrils, and obliquity of eyes; but these two formed the
extremes as to face and figure. None of them were tattooed or
disfigured in any way and they were all quite destitute of beard.
The Cuc&aacute;mas are notorious on the river for their provident
habits. The desire of acquiring property is so rare a trait in
Indians, that the habits of these people are remarked on with
surprise by the Brazilians. The first possession which they strive
to acquire on descending the river into Brazil, which all the
Peruvian Indians look upon as a richer country than their own, is a
wooden trunk with lock and key; in this they stow away carefully
all their earnings converted into clothing, hatchets, knives,
harpoon heads, needles and thread, and so forth. Their wages are
only fourpence or sixpence a day, which is often paid in goods
charged one hundred per cent above Par&aacute; prices, so that it
takes them a long time to fill their chest.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find a better-behaved set of men in a
voyage than these poor Indians. During our thirty-five days&rsquo;
journey they lived and worked together in the most perfect good
fellowship. I never heard an angry word pass amongst them. Senhor
Estulano let them navigate the vessel in their own way, exerting
his authority only now and then when they were inclined to be lazy.
Vicente regulated the working hours. These depended on the darkness
of the nights. In the first and second quarters of the moon they
kept it up with <i>espia</i>, or oars, until almost midnight; in
the third and fourth quarters they were allowed to go to sleep soon
after sunset, and were aroused at three or four o&rsquo;clock in
the morning to resume their work. On cool, rainy days we all bore a
hand at the <i>espia</i>, trotting with bare feet on the sloppy
deck in Indian file to the tune of some wild boatman&rsquo;s
chorus. We had a favorable wind for only two days out of the
thirty-five, by which we made about forty miles, the rest of our
long journey was accomplished literally by pulling our way from
tree to tree. When we encountered a <i>remanso</i> near the shore,
we got along very pleasantly for a few miles by rowing: but this
was a rare occurrence. During leisure hours the Indians employed
themselves in sewing. Vicente was a good hand at cutting out shirts
and trousers, and acted as master tailor to the whole party, each
of whom had a thick steel thimble and a stock of needles and thread
of his own. Vicente made for me a set of blue-check cotton shirts
during the passage.</p>

<p>The goodness of these Indians, like that of most others amongst
whom I lived, consisted perhaps more in the absence of active bad
qualities, than in the possession of good ones; in other words, it
was negative rather than positive. Their phlegmatic, apathetic
temperament, coldness of desire and deadness of feeling, want of
curiosity and slowness of intellect, make the Amazonian Indians
very uninteresting companions anywhere. Their imagination is of a
dull, gloomy, quality and they seemed never to be stirred by the
emotions:&mdash;love, pity, admiration, fear, wonder, joy, or
enthusiasm. These are characteristics of the whole race. The good
fellowship of our Cuc&aacute;mas seemed to arise not from warm
sympathy, but simply from the absence of eager selfishness in small
matters. On the morning when the favourable wind sprung up, one of
the crew, a lad of about seventeen years of age, was absent ashore
at the time of starting, having gone alone in one of the montarias
to gather wild fruit. The sails were spread and we travelled for
several hours at great speed, leaving the poor fellow to paddle
after us against the strong current. Vicente, who might have waited
a few minutes at starting, and the others, only laughed when the
hardship of their companion was alluded to. He overtook us at
night, having worked his way with frightful labor the whole day
without a morsel of food. He grinned when he came on board, and not
a dozen words were said on either side.</p>

<p>Their want of curiosity is extreme. One day we had an unusually
sharp thunder shower. The crew were lying about the deck, and after
each explosion all set up a loud laugh; the wag of the party
exclaiming: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my old uncle hunting again!&rdquo;
an expression showing the utter emptiness of mind of the spokesman.
I asked Vicente what he thought was the cause of lightning and
thunder? He said, &ldquo;Tima&aacute;
ichoqu&aacute;,&rdquo;&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. He had never given
the subject a moment&rsquo;s thought! It was the same with other
things. I asked him who made the sun, the stars, the trees? He
didn&rsquo;t know, and had never heard the subject mentioned
amongst his tribe. The Tup&iacute; language, at least as taught by
the old Jesuits, has a word&mdash;Tup&aacute;na&mdash;signifying
God. Vicente sometimes used this word, but he showed by his
expressions that he did not attach the idea of a Creator to it. He
seemed to think it meant some deity or visible image which the
whites worshipped in the churches he had seen in the villages. None
of the Indian tribes on the Upper Amazons have an idea of a Supreme
Being, and consequently have no word to express it in their own
language. Vicente thought the river on which we were travelling
encircled the whole earth, and that the land was an island like
those seen in the stream, but larger. Here a gleam of curiosity and
imagination in the Indian mind is revealed: the necessity of a
theory of the earth and water has been felt, and a theory has been
suggested. In all other matters not concerning the common wants of
life, the mind of Vicente was a blank and such I always found to be
the case with the Indian in his natural state. Would a community of
any race of men be otherwise, were they isolated for centuries in a
wilderness like the Amazonian Indians, associated in small numbers
wholly occupied in procuring a mere subsistence, and without a
written language, or a leisured class to hand down acquired
knowledge from generation to generation?</p>

<p>One day a smart squall gave us a good lift onward; it came with
a cold, fine, driving rain, which enveloped the desolate landscape
as with a mist; the forest swayed and roared with the force of the
gale, and flocks of birds were driven about in alarm over the tree
tops. On another occasion a similar squall came from an
unfavourable quarter; it fell upon us quite unawares, when we had
all our sails out to dry, and blew us broadside foremost on the
shore. The vessel was fairly lifted on to the tall bushes which
lined the banks, but we sustained no injury beyond the entanglement
of our rigging in the branches. The days and nights usually passed
in a dead calm, or with light intermittent winds from up river, and
consequently full against us. We landed twice a day to give
ourselves and the Indians a little rest and change, and to cook our
two meals&mdash;breakfast and dinner. There was another passenger
besides myself&mdash;a cautious, middle-aged Portuguese, who was
going to settle at Ega, where he had a brother long since
established. He was accommodated in the fore-cabin, or arched
covering over the hold. I shared the cabin-proper with Senhores
Estulano and Manoel, the latter a young half-caste, son-in-law to
the owner of the vessel, under whose tuition I made good progress
in learning the Tup&iacute; language during the voyage.</p>

<p>Our men took it in turns, two at a time, to go out fishing; for
which purpose we carried a spare montaria. The master had brought
from Barra as provision, nothing but stale, salt
piraruc&uacute;&mdash;half rotten fish, in large, thin, rusty
slabs&mdash;farinha, coffee, and treacle. In these voyages,
passengers are expected to provide for themselves, as no charge is
made except for freight of the heavy luggage or cargo they take
with them. The Portuguese and myself had brought a few luxuries,
such as beans, sugar, biscuits, tea, and so forth; but we found
ourselves almost obliged to share them with our two companions and
the pilot, so that before the voyage was one-third finished, the
small stock of most of these articles was exhausted. In return, we
shared in whatever the men brought. Sometimes they were quite
unsuccessful, for fish is extremely difficult to procure in the
season of high water, on account of the lower lands lying between
the inlets and infinite chain of pools and lakes being flooded from
the main river, thus increasing tenfold the area over which the
finny population has to range. On most days, however, they brought
two or three fine fish, and once they harpooned a manatee, or Vacca
marina. On this last-mentioned occasion we made quite a holiday;
the canoe was stopped for six or seven hours, and all turned out
into the forest to help skin and cook the animal. The meat was cut
into cubical slabs, and each person skewered a dozen or so of these
on a long stick. Fires were made, and the spits stuck in the ground
and slanted over the flames to roast. A drizzling rain fell all the
time, and the ground around the fires swarmed with stinging ants,
attracted by the entrails and slime which were scattered about. The
meat has somewhat the taste of very coarse pork; but the fat, which
lies in thick layers between the lean parts, is of a greenish
colour, and of a disagreeable, fishy flavour. The animal was a
large one, measuring nearly ten feet in length, and nine in girth
at the broadest part. The manatee is one of the few objects which
excite the dull wonder and curiosity of the Indians,
notwithstanding its commonness. The fact of its suckling its young
at the breast, although an aquatic animal resembling a fish, seems
to strike them as something very strange. The animal, as it lay on
its back, with its broad rounded head and muzzle, tapering body,
and smooth, thick, lead-coloured skin reminded me of those Egyptian
tombs which are made of dark, smooth stone, and shaped to the human
figure.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the hard fare, the confinement of the canoe, the
trying weather,&mdash;frequent and drenching rains, with gleams of
fiery sunshine,&mdash;and the woeful desolation of the river
scenery, I enjoyed the voyage on the whole. We were not much
troubled by mosquitoes, and therefore passed the nights very
pleasantly, sleeping on deck wrapped in blankets or old sails. When
the rains drove us below we were less comfortable, as there was
only just room in the small cabin for three of us to lie close
together, and the confined air was stifling. I became inured to the
Piums in the course of the first week; all the exposed parts of my
body, by that time, being so closely covered with black punctures
that the little bloodsuckers could not very easily find an
unoccupied place to operate upon. Poor Miguel, the Portuguese,
suffered horribly from these pests, his ankles and wrists being so
much inflamed that he was confined to his hammock, slung in the
hold, for weeks. At every landing place I had a ramble in the
forest, whilst the redskins made the fire and cooked the meal. The
result was a large daily addition to my collection of insects,
reptiles, and shells. Sometimes the neighbourhood of our gipsy-like
encampment was a tract of dry and spacious forest, pleasant to
ramble in; but more frequently it was a rank wilderness, into which
it was impossible to penetrate many yards, on account of uprooted
trees, entangled webs of monstrous woody climbers, thickets of
spiny bamboos, swamps, or obstacles of one kind or other. The drier
lands were sometimes beautified to the highest degree by groves of
the Urucur&iacute; palm (Attalea excelsa), which grew by the
thousands under the crowns of the lofty, ordinary forest trees;
their smooth columnar stems being all of nearly equal height (forty
or fifty feet), and their broad, finely-pinnated leaves
interlocking above to form arches and woven canopies of elegant and
diversified shapes. The fruit of this palm ripens on the upper
river in April, and during our voyage I saw immense quantities of
it strewn about under the trees in places where we encamped. It is
similar in size and shape to the date, and has a
pleasantly-flavoured juicy pulp. The Indians would not eat it; I
was surprised at this, as they greedily devoured many other kinds
of palm fruit whose sour and fibrous pulp was much less palatable.
Vicente shook his head when he saw me one day eating a quantity of
the Urucur&iacute; plums. I am not sure they were not the cause of
a severe indigestion under which I suffered for many days
afterwards.</p>

"Bulging-stemmed Palm: Pashi&uacute;ba barrigudo (Iriartea ventricosa)."
 align="right">

<p>In passing slowly along the interminable wooded banks week after
week, I observed that there were three tolerably distinct kinds of
coast and corresponding forest constantly recurring on this upper
river. First, there were the low and most recent alluvial
deposits,&mdash;a mixture of sand and mud, covered with tall,
broad-leaved grasses, or with the arrow-grass before described,
whose feathery-topped flower-stem rises to a height of fourteen or
fifteen feet. The only large trees which grow in these places are
the Cecropi&aelig;. Many of the smaller and newer islands were of
this description. Secondly, there were the moderately high banks,
which are only partially overflowed when the flood season is at its
height; these are wooded with a magnificent, varied forest, in
which a great variety of palms and broad-leaved Marantace&aelig;
form a very large proportion of the vegetation. The general foliage
is of a vivid light-green hue; the water frontage is sometimes
covered with a diversified mass of greenery; but where the current
sets strongly against the friable, earthy banks, which at low water
are twenty-five to thirty feet high, these are cut away, and expose
a section of forest where the trunks of trees loaded with epiphytes
appear in massy colonnades. One might safely say that three-fourths
of the land bordering the Upper Amazons, for a thousand miles,
belong to this second class. The third description of coast is the
higher, undulating, clayey land, which appears only at long
intervals, but extends sometimes for many miles along the borders
of the river. The coast at these places is sloping, and composed of
red or variegated clay. The forest is of a different character from
that of the lower tracts: it is rounder in outline, more uniform in
its general aspect; palms are much less numerous and of peculiar
species&mdash;the strange bulging-stemmed species, Iriartea
ventricosa, and the slender, glossy-leaved Bac&aacute;ba-&iacute;
(&OElig;nocarpus minor), being especially characteristic; and, in
short, animal life, which imparts some cheerfulness to the other
parts of the river, is seldom apparent. This &ldquo;terra
firme,&rdquo; as it is called, and a large portion of the fertile
lower land, seemed well adapted for settlement; some parts were
originally peopled by the aborigines, but these have long since
become extinct or amalgamated with the white immigrants. I
afterwards learned that there were not more than eighteen or twenty
families settled throughout the whole country from
Manac&aacute;pur&uacute; to Quary, a distance of 240 miles; and
these, as before observed, do not live on the banks of the main
stream, but on the shores of inlets and lakes.</p>

<p>The fishermen twice brought me small rounded pieces of very
porous pumice-stone, which they had picked up floating on the
surface of the main current of the river. They were to me objects
of great curiosity as being messengers from the distant volcanoes
of the Andes: Cotopaxi, Llanganete, or Sangay, which rear their
peaks amongst the rivulets that feed some of the early tributaries
of the Amazons, such as the Macas, the Pastaza, and the Napo. The
stones must have already travelled a distance of 1200 miles. I
afterwards found them rather common; the Brazilians use them for
cleaning rust from their guns, and firmly believe them to be
solidified river foam. A friend once brought me, when I lived at
Santarem, a large piece which had been found in the middle of the
stream below Monte Alegre, about 900 miles further down the river;
having reached this distance, pumice-stones would be pretty sure of
being carried out to sea, and floated thence with the
north-westerly Atlantic current to shores many thousand miles
distant from the volcanoes which ejected them. They are sometimes
stranded on the banks in different parts of the river. Reflecting
on this circumstance since I arrived in England, the probability of
these porous fragments serving as vehicles for the transportation
of seeds of plants, eggs of insects, spawn of fresh-water fish, and
so forth, has suggested itself to me. Their rounded, water-worn
appearance showed that they must have been rolled about for a long
time in the shallow streams near the sources of the rivers at the
feet of the volcanoes, before they leapt the waterfalls and
embarked on the currents which lead direct for the Amazons. They
may have been originally cast on the land and afterwards carried to
the rivers by freshets; in which case the eggs and seeds of land
insects and plants might be accidentally introduced and safely
enclosed with particles of earth in their cavities. As the speed of
the current in the rainy season has been observed to be from three
to five miles an hour, they might travel an immense distance before
the eggs or seeds were destroyed. I am ashamed to say that I
neglected the opportunity, whilst on the spot, of ascertaining
whether this was actually the case. The attention of Naturalists
has only lately been turned to the important subject of occasional
means of wide dissemination of species of animals and plants.
Unless such be shown to exist, it is impossible to solve some of
the most difficult problems connected with the distribution of
plants and animals. Some species, with most limited powers of
locomotion, are found in opposite parts of the earth, without
existing in the intermediate regions; unless it can be shown that
these may have migrated or been accidentally transported from one
point to the other, we shall have to come to the strange conclusion
that the same species had been created in two separate
districts.</p>

<br>
<p>Canoemen on the Upper Amazons live in constant dread of the
&ldquo;terras cahidas,&rdquo; or landslips, which occasionally take
place along the steep earthy banks, especially when the waters are
rising. Large vessels are sometimes overwhelmed by these avalanches
of earth and trees. I should have thought the accounts of them
exaggerated if I had not had an opportunity during this voyage of
seeing one on a large scale. One morning I was awakened before
sunrise by an unusual sound resembling the roar of artillery. I was
lying alone on the top of the cabin; it was very dark, and all my
companions were asleep, so I lay listening. The sounds came from a
considerable distance, and the crash which had aroused me was
succeeded by others much less formidable. The first explanation
which occurred to me was that it was an earthquake; for, although
the night was breathlessly calm, the broad river was much agitated
and the vessel rolled heavily. Soon after, another loud explosion
took place, apparently much nearer than the former one; then
followed others. The thundering peal rolled backwards and forwards,
now seeming close at hand, now far off; the sudden crashes being
often succeeded by a pause or a long-continued dull rumbling. At
the second explosion, Vicente, who lay snoring by the helm, awoke
and told me it was a &ldquo;terra cahida&rdquo;; but I could
scarcely believe him. The day dawned after the uproar had lasted
about an hour, and we then saw the work of destruction going
forward on the other side of the river, about three miles off.
Large masses of forest, including trees of colossal size, probably
200 feet in height, were rocking to and fro, and falling headlong
one after the other into the water. After each avalanche the wave
which it caused returned on the crumbly bank with tremendous force,
and caused the fall of other masses by undermining them. The line
of coast over which the landslip extended, was a mile or two in
length; the end of it, however, was hidden from our view by an
intervening island. It was a grand sight; each downfall created a
cloud of spray; the concussion in one place causing other masses to
give way a long distance from it, and thus the crashes continued,
swaying to and fro, with little prospect of a termination. When we
glided out of sight, two hours after sunrise, the destruction was
still going on.</p>

<br>
<p>On the 22nd we threaded the Paran&aacute;-mirim of
Arau&aacute;na-&iacute;, one of the numerous narrow bywaters which
lie conveniently for canoes away from the main river, and often
save a considerable circuit around a promontory or island. We rowed
for half a mile through a magnificent bed of Victoria waterlilies,
the flower-buds of which were just beginning to expand. Beyond the
mouth of the Catu&aacute;, a channel leading to one of the great
lakes so numerous in the plains of the Amazons, which we passed on
the 25th, the river appeared greatly increased in breadth. We
travelled for three days along a broad reach which both up and down
river presented a blank horizon of water and sky: this clear view
was owing to the absence of islands, but it renewed one&rsquo;s
impressions of the magnitude of the stream, which here, 1200 miles
from its mouth, showed so little diminution of width. Further
westward, a series of large islands commences, which divides the
river into two and sometimes three channels, each about a mile in
breadth. We kept to the southernmost of these, travelling all day
on the 30th of April along a high and rather sloping bank.</p>

<p>In the evening we arrived at a narrow opening, which would be
taken by a stranger navigating the main channel for the cutlet of
some insignificant stream: it was the mouth of the Teff&eacute;, on
whose banks Ega is situated, the termination of our voyage. After
having struggled for thirty-five days with the muddy currents and
insect pests of the Solimoens, it was unspeakably refreshing to
find one&rsquo;s-self again in a dark-water river, smooth as a
lake, and free from Pium and Mot&uacute;ca. The rounded outline,
small foliage, and sombre-green of the woods, which seemed to rest
on the glassy waters, made a pleasant contrast to the tumultuous
piles of rank, glaring, light-green vegetation, and torn,
timber-strewn banks to which we had been so long accustomed on the
main river. The men rowed lazily until nightfall, when, having done
a laborious day&rsquo;s work, they discontinued and went to sleep,
intending to make for Ega in the morning. It was not thought
worthwhile to secure the vessel to the trees or cast anchor, as
there was no current. I sat up for two or three hours after my
companions had gone to rest, enjoying the solemn calm of the night.
Not a breath of air stirred; the sky was of a deep blue, and the
stars seemed to stand forth in sharp relief; there was no sound of
life in the woods, except the occasional melancholy note of some
nocturnal bird. I reflected on my own wandering life; I had now
reached the end of the third stage of my journey, and was now more
than half way across the continent. It was necessary for me, on
many accounts, to find a rich locality for Natural History
explorations, and settle myself in it for some months or years.
Would the neighbourhood of Ega turn out to be suitable, and should
I, a solitary stranger on a strange errand, find a welcome amongst
its people?</p>

<p>Our Indians resumed their oars at sunrise the next morning (May
1st), and after an hour&rsquo;s rowing along the narrow channel,
which varies in breadth from 100 to 500 yards, we doubled a low
wooded point, and emerged suddenly on the so-called Lake of Ega: a
magnificent sheet of water, five miles broad, the expanded portion
of the Teff&eacute;. It is quite clear of islands, and curves away
to the west and south, so that its full extent is not visible from
this side. To the left, on a gentle grassy slope at the point of
junction of a broad tributary with the Teff&eacute;, lay the little
settlement: a cluster of a hundred or so of palm-thatched cottages
and white-washed red-tiled houses, each with its neatly-enclosed
orchard of orange, lemon, banana, and guava trees. Groups of palms,
with their tall slender shafts and feathery crowns, overtopped the
buildings and lower trees. A broad grass-carpeted street led from
the narrow strip of white sandy beach to the rudely-built barn-like
church, with its wooden crucifix on the green before it, in the
centre of the town. Cattle were grazing before the houses, and a
number of dark-skinned natives were taking their morning bath
amongst the canoes of various sizes, which were anchored or moored
to stakes in the port. We let off rockets and fired salutes,
according to custom, in token of our safe arrival, and shortly
afterwards went ashore.</p>

<p>A few days&rsquo; experience of the people and the forests of
the vicinity showed me that I might lay myself out for a long,
pleasant, and busy residence at this place. An idea of the kind of
people I had fallen amongst may be conveyed by an account of my
earliest acquaintances in the place. On landing, the owner of the
canoe killed an ox in honour of our arrival, and the next day took
me round the town to introduce me to the principal residents. We
first went to the Delegado of police, Senhor Antonio Cardozo, of
whom I shall have to make frequent mention by-and-by. He was a
stout, broad-featured man, ranking as a white, but having a tinge
of negro blood, his complexion, however, was ruddy, and scarcely
betrayed the mixture. He received us in a very cordial, winning
manner; I had afterwards occasion to be astonished at the boundless
good nature of this excellent fellow, whose greatest pleasure
seemed to be to make sacrifices for his friends. He was a Paraense,
and came to Ega originally as a trader; but, not succeeding in
this, he turned planter on a small scale and collector of the
natural commodities of the country, employing half-a-dozen Indians
in the business. We then visited the military commandant, an
officer in the Brazilian army, named Praia. He was breakfasting
with the Vicar, and we found the two in dishabille (morning-gown,
loose round the neck, and slippers), seated at a rude wooden table
in an open mud-floored verandah, at the back of the house.
Commander Praia was a little curly-headed man (also somewhat of a
mulatto), always merry and fond of practical jokes. His wife, Donna
Anna, a dressy dame from Santarem, was the leader of fashion in the
settlement. The Vicar, Father Luiz Gonsalvo Gomez, was a nearly
pure-blood Indian, a native of one of the neighbouring villages,
but educated at Maranham, a city on the Atlantic seaboard. I
afterwards saw a good deal of him, as he was an agreeable, sociable
fellow, fond of reading and hearing about foreign countries, and
quite free from the prejudices which might be expected in a man of
his profession. I found him, moreover, a thoroughly upright,
sincere, and virtuous man. He supported his aged mother and
unmarried sisters in a very creditable way out of his small salary
and emoluments. It is a pleasure to be able to speak in these terms
of a Brazilian priest, for the opportunity occurs rarely
enough.</p>

<p>Leaving these agreeable new acquaintances to finish their
breakfast, we next called on the Director of the Indians of the
Japura, Senhor Jos&eacute; Chrysostomo Monteiro, a thin wiry
Mameluco, the most enterprising person in the settlement. Each of
the neighbouring rivers with its numerous wild tribes is under the
control of a Director, who is nominated by the Imperial Government.
There are now no missions in the regions of the Upper Amazons; the
&ldquo;gentios&rdquo; (heathens, or unbaptised Indians) being
considered under the management and protection of these despots,
who, like the captains of Trabalhadores, before mentioned, use the
natives for their own private ends. Senhor Chrysostomo had, at this
time, 200 of the Japura Indians in his employ. He was half Indian
himself, but was a far worse master to the redskins than the whites
usually are. We finished our rounds by paying our respects to a
venerable native merchant, Senhor Romao de Oliveira, a tall,
corpulent, fine-looking old man, who received us with a naive
courtesy quite original in its way. He had been an industrious,
enterprising man in his younger days, and had built a substantial
range of houses and warehouses. The shrewd and able old gentleman
knew nothing of the world beyond the wilderness of the Solimoens
and its few thousands of isolated inhabitants, yet he could
converse well and sensibly, making observations on men and things
as sagaciously as though he had drawn them from long experience of
life in a European capital. The semi-civilised Indians respected
old Romao, and he had, consequently, a great number in his employ
in different parts of the river: his vessels were always filled
quicker with produce than those of his neighbours. On our leaving,
he placed his house and store at my disposal. This was not a piece
of empty politeness, for some time afterwards, when I wished to
settle for the goods I had had of him, he refused to take any
payment.</p>

<br>
<p>I made Ega my headquarters during the whole of the time I
remained on the Upper Amazons (four years and a half). My
excursions into the neighbouring region extended sometimes as far
as 300 and 400 miles from the place. An account of these excursions
will be given in subsequent chapters; in the intervals between them
I led a quiet, uneventful life in the settlement, following my
pursuit in the same peaceful, regular way as a Naturalist might do
in a European village. For many weeks in succession my journal
records little more than the notes made on my daily captures. I had
a dry and specious cottage, the principal room of which was made a
workshop and study; here a large table was placed, and my little
library of reference arranged on shelves in rough wooden boxes.
Cages for drying specimens were suspended from the rafters by cords
well anointed, to prevent ants from descending, with a bitter
vegetable oil; rats and mice were kept from them by inverted <i>
cuyas</i>, placed half way down the cords. I always kept on hand a
large portion of my private collection, which contained a pair of
each species and variety, for the sake of comparing the old with
the new acquisitions. My cottage was whitewashed inside and out
about once a year by the proprietor, a native trader; the floor was
of earth; the ventilation was perfect, for the outside air, and
sometimes the rain as well, entered freely through gaps at the top
of the walls under the eaves and through wide crevices in the
doorways. Rude as the dwelling was, I look back with pleasure on
the many happy months I spent in it. I rose generally with the sun,
when the grassy streets were wet with dew, and walked down to the
river to bathe; five or six hours of every morning were spent in
collecting in the forest, whose borders lay only five
minutes&rsquo; walk from my house; the hot hours of the afternoon,
between three and six o&rsquo;clock, and the rainy days, were
occupied in preparing and ticketing the specimens, making notes,
dissecting, and drawing. I frequently had short rambles by water in
a small montaria, with an Indian lad to paddle. The neighbourhood
yielded me, up to the last day of my residence, an uninterrupted
succession of new and curious forms in the different classes of the
animal kingdom, and especially insects.</p>

<p>I lived, as may already have been seen, on the best of terms
with the inhabitants of Ega. Refined society, of course, there was
none; but the score or so of decent quiet families which
constituted the upper class of the place were very sociable; their
manners offered a curious mixture of naive rusticity and formal
politeness; the great desire to be thought civilised leads the most
ignorant of these people (and they are all very ignorant, although
of quick intelligence) to be civil and kind to strangers from
Europe. I was never troubled with that impertinent curiosity on the
part of the people in these interior places which some travellers
complain of in other countries. The Indians and lower
half-castes&mdash;at least such of them who gave any thought to the
subject&mdash;seemed to think it natural that strangers should
collect and send abroad the beautiful birds and insects of their
country. The butterflies they universally concluded to be wanted as
patterns for bright-coloured calico-prints. As to the better sort
of people, I had no difficulty in making them understand that each
European capital had a public museum, in which were sought to be
stored specimens of all natural productions in the mineral, animal,
and vegetable kingdoms. They could not comprehend how a man could
study science for its own sake; but I told them I was collecting
for the &ldquo;Museo de Londres,&rdquo; and was paid for it; <i>
that</i> was very intelligible. One day, soon after my arrival,
when I was explaining these things to a listening circle seated on
benches in the grassy street, one of the audience, a considerable
tradesman, a Mameluco native of Ega, got suddenly quite
enthusiastic, and exclaimed, &ldquo;How rich are these great
nations of Europe! We half-civilised creatures know nothing. Let us
treat this stranger well, that he may stay amongst us and teach our
children.&rdquo; We very frequently had social parties, with
dancing and so forth; of these relaxations I shall have more to say
presently. The manners of the Indian population also gave me some
amusement for a long time. During the latter part of my residence,
three wandering Frenchmen, and two Italians, some of them men of
good education, on their road one after the other from the Andes
down the Amazons, became enamoured of this delightfully situated
and tranquil spot, and made up their minds to settle here for the
remainder of their lives. Three of them ended by marrying native
women. I found the society of these friends a very agreeable
change.</p>

<p>There were, of course, many drawbacks to the amenities of the
place as a residence for a European; but these were not of a nature
that my readers would perhaps imagine. There was scarcely any
danger from wild animals: it seems almost ridiculous to refute the
idea of danger from the natives in a country where even incivility
to an unoffending stranger is a rarity. A jaguar, however, paid us
a visit one night. It was considered an extraordinary event, and so
much uproar was made by the men who turned out with guns and bows
and arrows, that the animal scampered off and was heard of no more.
Alligators were rather troublesome in the dry season. During these
months there was almost always one or two lying in wait near the
bathing place for anything that might turn up at the edge of the
water; dog, sheep, pig, child, or drunken Indian. When this visitor
was about every one took extra care whilst bathing. I used to
imitate the natives in not advancing far from the bank, and in
keeping my eye fixed on that of the monster, which stares with a
disgusting leer along the surface of the water; the body being
submerged to the level of the eyes, and the top of the head, with
part of the dorsal crest the only portions visible. When a little
motion was perceived in the water behind the reptile&rsquo;s tail,
bathers were obliged to beat a quick retreat. I was never
threatened myself, but I often saw the crowds of women and children
scared whilst bathing by the beast making a movement towards them;
a general scamper to the shore and peals of laughter were always
the result in these cases. The men can always destroy these
alligators when they like to take the trouble to set out with
montarias and harpoons for the purpose; but they never do it unless
one of the monsters, bolder than usual, puts some one&rsquo;s life
in danger. This arouses them, and they then track the enemy with
the greatest pertinacity; when half-killed, they drag it ashore and
dispatch it amid loud execrations. Another, however, is sure to
appear some days or weeks afterwards and take the vacant place on
the station. Besides alligators, the only animals to be feared are
the poisonous serpents. These are certainly common enough in the
forest, but no fatal accident happened during the whole time of my
residence.</p>

<p>I suffered most inconvenience from the difficulty of getting
news from the civilised world down river, from the irregularity of
receipt of letters, parcels of books and periodicals, and towards
the latter part of my residence from ill health arising from bad
and insufficient food. The want of intellectual society, and of the
varied excitement of European life, was also felt most acutely, and
this, instead of becoming deadened by time, increased until it
became almost insupportable. I was obliged, at last, to come to the
conclusion that the contemplation of Nature alone is not sufficient
to fill the human heart and mind. I got on pretty well when I
received a parcel from England by the steamer, once in two or four
months. I used to be very economical with my stock of reading lest
it should be finished before the next arrival, and leave me utterly
destitute. I went over the periodicals, the <i>Athen&aelig;um</i>,
for instance, with great deliberation, going through every number
three times; the first time devouring the more interesting
articles; the second, the whole of the remainder; and the third,
reading all the advertisements from beginning to end. If four
months (two steamers) passed without a fresh parcel, I felt
discouraged in the extreme. I was worst off in the first year,
1850, when twelve months elapsed without letters or remittances.
Towards the end of this time my clothes had worn to rags; I was
barefoot, a great inconvenience in tropical forests,
notwithstanding statements to the contrary that have been published
by travellers; my servant ran away, and I was robbed of nearly all
my copper money. I was obliged then to descend to Par&aacute;, but
returned, after finishing the examination of the middle part of the
Lower Amazons and the Tapajos, in 1855, with my Santarem assistant
and better provided for making collections on the upper river. This
second visit was in pursuit of the plan before mentioned, of
exploring in detail the whole valley of the Amazons, which I formed
in Par&aacute; in the year 1851.</p>

<p>During so long a residence I witnessed, of course, many changes
in the place. Some of the good friends who made me welcome on my
first arrival, died, and I followed their remains to their last
resting-place in the little rustic cemetery on the borders of the
surrounding forest. I lived there long enough, from first to last,
to see the young people grow up, attended their weddings, and the
christenings of their children, and, before I left, saw them old
married folks with numerous families. In 1850 Ega was only a
village, dependent on Par&aacute; 1400 miles distant, as the
capital of the then undivided province. In 1852, with the creation
of the new province of the Amazons, it became a city; returned its
members to the provincial parliament at Barra; had it assizes, its
resident judges, and rose to be the chief town of the <i>
comarca</i> or county. A year after this, namely, in 1853, steamers
were introduced on the Solimoens; and from 1855, one ran regularly
every two months between the Rio Negro and Nauta in Peru, touching
at all the villages, and accomplishing the distance in ascending,
about 1200 miles, in eighteen days. The trade and population,
however, did not increase with these changes. The people became
more &ldquo;civilised,&rdquo; that is, they began to dress
according to the latest Parisian fashions, instead of going about
in stockingless feet, wooden clogs, and shirt sleeves, acquired a
taste for money-getting and office-holding; became divided into
parties, and lost part of their former simplicity of manners. But
the place remained, when I left it in 1859, pretty nearly what it
was when I first arrived in 1850&mdash;a semi-Indian village, with
much in the ways and notions of its people more like those of a
small country town in Northern Europe than a South American
settlement. The place is healthy, and almost free from insect
pests: perpetual verdure surrounds it; the soil is of marvellous
fertility, even for Brazil; the endless rivers and labyrinths of
channels teem with fish and turtle, a fleet of steamers might
anchor at any season of the year in the lake, which has
uninterrupted water communication straight to the Atlantic. What a
future is in store for the sleepy little tropical village!</p>

<p>After speaking of Ega as a city, it will have a ludicrous effect
to mention that the total number of its inhabitants is only about
1200. It contains just 107 houses, about half of which are
miserably built mud-walled cottages, thatched with palm-leaves. A
fourth of the population are almost always absent, trading or
collecting produce on the rivers. The neighbourhood within a radius
of thirty miles, and including two other small villages, contains
probably 2000 more people. The settlement is one of the oldest in
the country, having been founded in 1688 by Father Samuel Fritz, a
Bohemian Jesuit, who induced several of the docile tribes of
Indians, then scattered over the neighbouring region, to settle on
the site. From 100 to 200 acres of sloping ground around the place
were afterwards cleared of timber; but such is the encroaching
vigour of vegetation in this country that the site would quickly
relapse into jungle if the inhabitants neglected to pull up the
young shoots as they arose. There is a stringent municipal law
which compels each resident to weed a given space around his
dwelling. Every month, whilst I resided here, an inspector came
round with his wand of authority, and fined every one who had not
complied with the regulation. The Indians of the surrounding
country have never been hostile to the European settlers. The
rebels of Par&aacute; and the Lower Amazons, in 1835-6, did not
succeed in rousing the natives of the Solimoens against the whites.
A party of forty of them ascended the river for that purpose, but
on arriving at Ega, instead of meeting with sympathisers as in
other places, they were surrounded by a small body of armed
residents, and shot down without mercy. The military commandant at
the time, who was the prime mover in this orderly resistance to
anarchy, was a courageous and loyal negro, named Jos&eacute;
Patricio, an officer known throughout the Upper Amazons for his
unflinching honesty and love of order, whose acquaintance I had the
pleasure of making at St. Paulo in 1858. Ega was the headquarters
of the great scientific commission, which met in the years from
1781 to 1791 to settle the boundaries between the Spanish and
Portuguese territories in South America. The chief commissioner for
Spain, Don Francisco Requena, lived some time in the village with
his family. I found only one person at Ega, my old friend Romao de
Oliveira, who recollected, or had any knowledge of this important
time, when a numerous staff of astronomers, surveyors, and
draughtsmen, explored much of the surrounding country with large
bodies of soldiers and natives.</p>

<p>More than half the inhabitants of Ega are Mamelucos; there are
not more than forty or fifty pure whites; the number of negroes and
mulattos is probably a little less, and the rest of the population
consists of pure blood Indians. Every householder, including
Indians and free negroes, is entitled to a vote in the elections,
municipal, provincial, and imperial, and is liable to be called on
juries, and to serve in the national guard. These privileges and
duties of citizenship do not seem at present to be appreciated by
the more ignorant coloured people. There is, however, a gradual
improvement taking place in this respect. Before I left there was a
rather sharp contest for the Presidency of the Municipal Chamber,
and most of the voters took a lively interest in it. There was also
an election of members to represent the province in the Imperial
Parliament at Rio Janeiro, in which each party strove hard to
return its candidate. On this occasion, an unscrupulous lawyer was
sent by the government party from the capital to overawe the
opposition to its nominee; many of the half-castes, headed by my
old friend John da Cunha, who was then settled at Ega, fought hard,
but with perfect legality and good humour, against this powerful
interest. They did not succeed; and although the government agent
committed many tyrannical and illegal acts, the losing party
submitted quietly to their defeat. In a larger town, I believe, the
government would not have dared to attempt thus to control the
elections. I think I saw enough to warrant the conclusion that the
machinery of constitutional government would, with a little longer
trial, work well amongst the mixed Indian, white, and negro
population, even in this remote part of the Brazilian empire. I
attended also, before I left, several assize meetings at Ega, and
witnessed the novel sight of negro, white, half-caste, and Indian,
sitting gravely side by side on the jury bench.</p>

<p>The way in which the coloured races act under the conditions of
free citizenship is a very interesting subject. Brazilian statesmen
seem to have abandoned the idea, if they ever entertained it, of
making this tropical empire a nation of whites with a slave
labouring class. The greatest difficulty on the Amazons is with the
Indians. The general inflexibility of character of the race, and
their abhorrence of the restraints of civilised life, make them
very intractable subjects. Some of them, however, who have learned
to read and write, and whose dislike to live in towns has been
overcome by some cause acting early in life, make very good
citizens. I have already mentioned the priest, who is a good
example of what early training can do. There can be no doubt that
if the docile Amazonian Indians were kindly treated by their white
fellow-citizens, and educated, they would not be so quick as they
have hitherto shown themselves to be to leave the towns and return
into their half wild condition on the advancing civilisation of the
places. The inflexibility of character, although probably organic,
is seen to be sometimes overcome. The principal blacksmith of Ega,
Senhor Macedo, was also an Indian, and a very sensible fellow. He
sometimes filled minor offices in the government of the place. He
used to come very frequently to my house to chat, and was always
striving to acquire solid information about things. When
Donati&rsquo;s comet appeared, he took a great interest in it. We
saw it at its best from the 3rd to the 10th of October (1858),
between which dates it was visible near the western horizon just
after sunset, the tail extending in a broad curve towards the
north, and forming a sublime object. Macedo consulted all the old
almanacs in the place to ascertain whether it was the same comet as
that of 1811, which he said he well remembered. Before the Indians
can be reclaimed in large numbers, it is most likely they will
become extinct as a race; but there is less difficulty with regard
to the Mamelucos, who, even when the proportion of white blood is
small, sometimes become enterprising and versatile people.</p>

<p>Many of the Ega Indians, including all the domestic servants,
are savages who have been brought from the neighbouring rivers; the
Japur&aacute;, the Iss&aacute;, and the Solimoens. I saw here
individuals of at least sixteen different tribes, most of whom had
been bought, when children, of the native chiefs. This species of
slave-dealing, although forbidden by the laws of Brazil, is winked
at by the authorities, because without it, there would be no means
of obtaining servants. They all become their own masters when they
grow up, and never show the slightest inclination to return to
utter savage life. But the boys generally run away and embark on
the canoes of traders; and the girls are often badly treated by
their mistresses; the jealous, passionate, and ill-educated
Brazilian women. Nearly all the enmities which arise amongst
residents at Ega and other place, are caused by disputes about
Indian servants. No one who has lived only in old settled
countries, where service can be readily bought, can imagine the
difficulties and annoyances of a land where the servant class are
ignorant of the value of money, and hands cannot be obtained except
by coaxing them from the employ of other masters.</p>

<p>Great mortality takes place amongst the poor captive children on
their arrival at Ega. It is a singular circumstance that the
Indians residing on the Japura and other tributaries always fall
ill on descending to the Solimoens, whilst the reverse takes place
with the inhabitants of the banks of the main river, who never fail
of taking intermittent fever when they first ascend these branch
rivers, and of getting well when they return. The finest tribes of
savages who inhabit the country near Ega are the Jur&iacute;s and
Pass&eacute;s: these are now, however, nearly extinct, a few
families only remaining on the banks of the retired creeks
connected with the Teff&eacute;, and on other branch rivers between
the Teff&eacute; and the Jutah&iacute;. They are a peaceable,
gentle, and industrious people, devoted to agriculture and fishing,
and have always been friendly to the whites. I shall have occasion
to speak again of the Pass&eacute;s, who are a slenderly-built and
superior race of Indians, distinguished by a large, square tattooed
patch in the middle of their faces. The principal cause of their
decay in numbers seems to be a disease which always appears amongst
them when a village is visited by people from the civilised
settlements&mdash;a slow fever, accompanied by the symptoms of a
common cold, &ldquo;defluxo,&rdquo; as the Brazilians term it,
ending probably in consumption. The disorder has been known to
break out when the visitors were entirely free from it; the simple
contact of civilised men, in some mysterious way, being sufficient
to create it. It is generally fatal to the Jur&iacute;s and
Pass&eacute;s; the first question the poor, patient Indians now put
to an advancing canoe is, &ldquo;Do you bring defluxo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>My assistant, Jos&eacute;, in the last year of our residence at
Ega, &ldquo;resgatou&rdquo; (ransomed, the euphemism in use for
purchased) two Indian children, a boy and a girl, through a
Japur&aacute; trader. The boy was about twelve years of age, and of
an unusually dark colour of skin: he had, in fact, the tint of a
Cafuzo, the offspring of Indian and negro. It was thought he had
belonged to some perfectly wild and houseless tribe, similar to the
Par&aacute;rau&aacute;tes of the Tapajos, of which there are
several in different parts of the interior of South America. His
face was of regular, oval shape, but his glistening black eyes had
a wary, distrustful expression, like that of a wild animal; his
hands and feet were small and delicately formed. Soon after his
arrival, finding that none of the Indian boys and girls in the
houses of our neighbours understood his language, he became sulky
and reserved; not a word could be got from him until many weeks
afterwards, when he suddenly broke out with complete phrases of
Portuguese. He was ill of swollen liver and spleen, the result of
intermittent fever, for a long time after coming into our hands. We
found it difficult to cure him, owing to his almost invincible
habit of eating earth, baked clay, pitch, wax, and other similar
substances. Very many children on the upper parts of the Amazons
have this strange habit; not only Indians, but negroes and whites.
It is not, therefore, peculiar to the famous Otomacs of the
Orinoco, described by Humboldt, or to Indians at all, and seems to
originate in a morbid craving, the result of a meagre diet of fish,
wild-fruits, and mandioca-meal. We gave our little savage the name
of Sebastian. The use of these Indian children is to fill
water-jars from the river, gather firewood in the forest, cook,
assist in paddling the montaria in excursions, and so forth.
Sebastian was often my companion in the woods, where he was very
useful in finding the small birds I shot, which sometimes fell in
the thickets amongst confused masses of fallen branches and dead
leaves. He was wonderfully expert at catching lizards with his
hands, and at climbing. The smoothest stems of palm-trees offered
little difficulty to him; he would gather a few lengths of tough,
flexible lianas, tie them in a short, endless band to support his
feet with, in embracing the slippery shaft, and then mount upwards
by a succession of slight jerks. It was very amusing, during the
first few weeks, to witness the glee and pride with which he would
bring to me the bunches of fruit he had gathered from almost
inaccessible trees. He avoided the company of boys of his own race,
and was evidently proud of being the servant of a real white man.
We brought him down with us to Par&aacute;, but he showed no
emotion at any of the strange sights of the capital; the
steam-vessels, large ships and houses, horses and carriages, the
pomp of church ceremonies, and so forth. In this he exhibited the
usual dullness of feeling and poverty of thought of the Indian; he
had, nevertheless, very keen perceptions, and was quick at learning
any mechanical art. Jos&eacute;, who had resumed, some time before
I left the country, his old trade of goldsmith, made him his
apprentice, and he made very rapid progress; for after about three
months&rsquo; teaching he came to me one day with radiant
countenance and showed me a gold ring of his own making.</p>

<p>The fate of the little girl, who came with a second batch of
children all ill of intermittent fever, a month or two after
Sebastian, was very different. She was brought to our house, after
landing, one night in the wet season, when the rain was pouring in
torrents, thin and haggard, drenched with wet and shivering with
ague. An old Indian who brought her to the door said briefly,
&ldquo;ecui encommenda&rdquo; (here&rsquo;s your little parcel, or
order), and went away. There was very little of the savage in her
appearance, and she was of a much lighter colour than the boy. We
found she was of the Mir&aacute;nha tribe, all of whom are
distinguished by a slit, cut in the middle of each wing of the
nose, in which they wear on holiday occasions a large button made
of pearly river-shell. We took the greatest care of our little
patient; had the best nurses in the town, fomented her daily, gave
her quinine and the most nourishing food; but it was all of no
avail, she sank rapidly; her liver was enormously swollen, and
almost as hard to the touch as stone. There was something
uncommonly pleasing in her ways, and quite unlike anything I had
yet seen in Indians. Instead of being dull and taciturn, she was
always smiling and full of talk. We had an old woman of the same
tribe to attend her, who explained what she said to us. She often
begged to be taken to the river to bathe; asked for fruit, or
coveted articles she saw in the room for playthings. Her native
name was Oria. The last week or two she could not rise from the bed
we had made for her in a dry corner of the room; when she wanted
lifting, which, was very often, she would allow no one to help her
but me, calling me by the name of &ldquo;Car&iacute;wa&rdquo;
(white man), the only word of Tup&iacute; she seemed to know. It
was inexpressibly touching to hear her, as she lay, repeating by
the hour the verses which she had been taught to recite with her
companions in her native village: a few sentences repeated over and
over again with a rhythmic accent, and relating to objects and
incidents connected with the wild life of her tribe. We had her
baptised before she died, and when this latter event happened, in
opposition to the wishes of the big people of Ega, I insisted on
burying her with the same honours as a child of the whites; that
is, as an &ldquo;anjinho&rdquo; (little angel), according to the
pretty Roman Catholic custom of the country. We had the corpse
clothed in a robe of fine calico, crossed her hands on her breast
over a &ldquo;palma&rdquo; of flowers, and made also a crown of
flowers for her head. Scores of helpless children like our poor
Oria die at Ega, or on the road; but generally not the slightest
care is taken of them during their illness. They are the captives
made during the merciless raids of one section of the
Mir&aacute;nha tribe on the territories of another, and sold to the
Ega traders. The villages of the attacked hordes are surprised, and
the men and women killed or driven into the thickets without having
time to save their children. There appears to be no doubt that the
Mir&aacute;nhas are cannibals, and, therefore, the purchase of
these captives probably saves them from a worse fate. The demand
for them at Ega operates, however, as a direct cause of the supply,
stimulating the unscrupulous chiefs, who receive all the profits,
to undertake these murderous expeditions.</p>

<p>It is remarkable how quickly the savages of the various nations,
which each have their own, to all appearance, widely different
language, learn Tup&iacute; on their arrival at Ega, where it is
the common idiom. This perhaps may be attributed chiefly to the
grammatical forms of all the Indian tongues being the same,
although the words are different. As far as I could learn, the
feature is common to all, of placing the preposition <i>after</i>
the noun, making it, in fact, a <i>post</i>-position, thus:
&ldquo;He is come the village <i>from</i>;&rdquo; &ldquo;Go him <i>
with</i>, the plantation <i>to</i>,&rdquo; and so forth. The ideas
to be expressed in their limited sphere of life and thought are
few; consequently the stock of words is extremely small; besides,
all Indians have the same way of thinking, and the same objects to
talk about; these circumstances also contribute to the case with
which they learn each other&rsquo;s language. Hordes of the same
tribe living on the same branch rivers, speak mutually
unintelligible languages; this happens with the Mir&aacute;nhas on
the Japur&aacute;, and with the Coll&iacute;nas on the
Jur&uacute;a; whilst Tup&iacute; is spoken with little corruption
along the banks of the main Amazons for a distance Of 2500 miles.
The purity of Tup&iacute; is kept up by frequent communication
amongst the natives, from one end to the other of the main river;
how complete and long-continued must be the isolation in which the
small groups of savages have lived in other parts, to have caused
so complete a segregation of dialects! It is probable that the
strange inflexibility of the Indian organisation, both bodily and
mental, is owing to the isolation in which each small tribe has
lived, and to the narrow round of life and thought, and close
intermarriages for countless generations which are the necessary
results. Their fecundity is of a low degree, for it is very rare to
find an Indian family having so many as four children, and we have
seen how great is their liability to sickness and death on removal
from place to place.</p>

<p>I have already remarked on the different way in which the
climate of this equatorial region affects Indians and negroes. No
one could live long amongst the Indians of the Upper Amazons
without being struck with their constitutional dislike to the heat.
Europeans certainly withstand the high temperature better than the
original inhabitants of the country; I always found I could myself
bear exposure to the sun or unusually hot weather quite as well as
the Indians, although not well-fitted by nature for a hot climate.
Their skin is always hot to the touch, and they perspire little. No
Indian resident of Ega can be induced to stay in the village (where
the heat is felt more than in the forest or on the river), for many
days together. They bathe many times a day, but do not plunge in
the water, taking merely a <i>sitz-bath</i>, as dogs may be seen
doing in hot climates, to cool the lower parts of the body. The
women and children, who often remain at home, whilst the men are
out for many days together fishing, generally find some excuse for
trooping off to the shades of the forest in the hot hours of the
afternoons. They are restless and discontented in fine dry weather,
but cheerful in cool days, when the rain is pouring down on their
naked backs. When suffering under fever, nothing but strict
watching can prevent them from going down to bathe in the river, or
eating immoderate quantities of juicy fruits, although these
indulgences are frequently the cause of death. They are very
subject to disorders of the liver, dysentery, and other diseases of
hot climates, and when any epidemic is about, they fall ill
quicker, and suffer more than negroes or even whites. How different
all this is with the negro, the true child of tropical climes! The
impression gradually forced itself on my mind that the red Indian
lives as a stranger, or immigrant in these hot regions, and that
his constitution was not originally adapted, and has not since
become perfectly adapted, to the climate.</p>

<p>The Indian element is very prominent in the amusements of the
Ega people. All the Roman Catholic holidays are kept up with great
spirit; rude Indian sports being mingled with the ceremonies
introduced by the Portuguese. Besides these, the aborigines
celebrate their own ruder festivals; the people of different tribes
combining; for, in most of their features, the merry-makings were
originally alike in all the tribes. The Indian idea of a holiday is
bonfires, processions, masquerading, especially the mimicry of
different kinds of animals, plenty of confused drumming and fifing,
monotonous dancing, kept up hour after hour without intermission,
and, the most important point of all, getting gradually and
completely drunk. But he attaches a kind of superstitious
significance to these acts, and thinks that the amusements appended
to the Roman Catholic holidays as celebrated by the descendants of
the Portuguese, are also an essential part of the religious
ceremonies. But in this respect, the uneducated whites and
half-breeds are not a bit more enlightened than the poor,
dull-souled Indian. All look upon a religious holiday as an
amusement, in which the priest takes the part of director or chief
actor.</p>

<p>Almost every unusual event, independent of saints&rsquo; days,
is made the occasion of a holiday by the sociable, easy-going
people of the white and Mameluco classes; funerals, christenings,
weddings, the arrival of strangers, and so forth. The custom of
&ldquo;waking&rdquo; the dead is also kept up. A few days after I
arrived, I was awoke in the middle of a dark moist night by
Cardozo, to sit up with a neighbour whose wife had just died. I
found the body laid out on a table, with crucifix and lighted
wax-candles at the head, and the room full of women and girls
squatted on stools or on their haunches. The men were seated round
the open door, smoking, drinking coffee, and telling stories, the
bereaved husband exerting himself much to keep the people merry
during the remainder of the night. The Ega people seem to like an
excuse for turning night into day; it is so cool and pleasant, and
they can sit about during these hours in the open air, clad as
usual in simple shirt and trousers, without streaming with
perspiration.</p>

<p>The patron saint is Santa Theresa, the festival at whose
anniversary lasts, like most of the others, ten days. It begins
very quietly with evening litanies sung in the church, which are
attended by the greater part of the population, all clean and gaily
dressed in calicos and muslins; the girls wearing jasmines and
other natural flowers in their hair, no other headdress being worn
by females of any class. The evenings pass pleasantly; the church
is lighted up with wax candles, and illuminated on the outside by a
great number of little oil lamps&mdash;rude clay cups, or halves of
the thick rind of the bitter orange, which are fixed all over the
front. The congregation seem very attentive, and the responses to
the litany of Our Lady, sung by a couple of hundred fresh female
voices, ring agreeably through the still village. Towards the end
of the festival the fun commences. The managers of the feast keep
open houses, and dancing, drumming, tinkling of wire guitars, and
unbridled drinking by both sexes, old and young, are kept up for a
couple of days and a night with little intermission. The ways of
the people at these merry-makings, of which there are many in the
course of the year, always struck me as being not greatly different
from those seen at an old-fashioned village wake in retired parts
of England. The old folks look on and get very talkative over their
cups; the children are allowed a little extra indulgence in sitting
up; the dull, reserved fellows become loquacious, shake one another
by the hand or slap each other on the back, discovering, all at
once, what capital friends they are. The cantankerous individual
gets quarrelsome, and the amorous unusually loving. The Indian,
ordinarily so taciturn, finds the use of his tongue, and gives the
minutest details of some little dispute which he had with his
master years ago, and which everyone else had forgotten; just as I
have known lumpish labouring men in England do, when half-fuddled.
One cannot help reflecting, when witnessing these traits of
manners, on the similarity of human nature everywhere, when classes
are compared whose state of culture and conditions of life are
pretty nearly the same.</p>

<p>The Indians play a conspicuous part in the amusements at St.
John&rsquo;s eve, and at one or two other holidays which happen
about that time of the year&mdash;the end of June. In some of the
sports the Portuguese element is visible, in others the Indian, but
it must be recollected that masquerading, recitative singing, and
so forth, are common originally to both peoples. A large number of
men and boys disguise themselves to represent different grotesque
figures, animals, or persons. Two or three dress themselves up as
giants, with the help of a tall framework. One enacts the part of
the Cayp&oacute;r, a kind of sylvan deity similar to the
Curup&iacute;ra which I have before mentioned. The belief in this
being seems to be common to all the tribes of the Tup&iacute;
stock. According to the figure they dressed up at Ega, he is a
bulky, misshapen monster, with red skin and long shaggy red hair
hanging half way down his back. They believe that he has
subterranean campos and hunting grounds in the forest, well stocked
with pacas and deer. He is not at all an object of worship nor of
fear, except to children, being considered merely as a kind of
hobgoblin. Most of the masquers make themselves up as
animals&mdash;bulls, deer, magoary storks, jaguars, and so forth,
with the aid of light frameworks, covered with old cloth dyed or
painted and shaped according to the object represented. Some of the
imitations which I saw were capital. One ingenious fellow arranged
an old piece of canvas in the form of a tapir, placed himself under
it, and crawled about on all fours. He constructed an elastic nose
to resemble that of the tapir, and made, before the doors of the
principal residents, such a good imitation of the beast grazing,
that peals of laughter greeted him wherever he went. Another man
walked about solitarily, masked as a jabiru crane (a large animal
standing about four feet high), and mimicked the gait and habits of
the bird uncommonly well. One year an Indian lad imitated me, to
the infinite amusement of the townsfolk. He came the previous day
to borrow of me an old blouse and straw hat. I felt rather taken in
when I saw him, on the night of the performance, rigged out as an
entomologist, with an insect net, hunting bag, and pincushion. To
make the imitation complete, he had borrowed the frame of an old
pair of spectacles, and went about with it straddled over his nose.
The jaguar now and then made a raid amongst the crowd of boys who
were dressed as deer, goats, and so forth. The masquers kept
generally together, moving from house to house, and the
performances were directed by an old musician, who sang the orders
and explained to the spectators what was going forward in a kind of
recitative, accompanying himself on a wire guitar. The mixture of
Portuguese and Indian customs is partly owing to the European
immigrants in these parts having been uneducated men, who, instead
of introducing European civilisation, have descended almost to the
level of the Indians, and adopted some of their practices. The
performances take place in the evening, and occupy five or six
hours; bonfires are lighted along the grassy streets, and the
families of the better class are seated at their doors, enjoying
the wild but good-humoured fun.</p>

<p>We lived at Ega, during most part of the year, on turtle. The
great fresh-water turtle of the Amazons grows on the upper river to
an immense size, a full-grown one measuring nearly three feet in
length by two in breadth, and is a load for the strongest Indian.
Every house has a little pond, called a curral (pen), in the
backyard to hold a stock of the animals through the season of
dearth&mdash;the wet months; those who have a number of Indians in
their employ send them out for a month when the waters are low, to
collect a stock, and those who have not, purchasing their supply;
with some difficulty, however, as they are rarely offered for sale.
The price of turtles, like that of all other articles of food, has
risen greatly with the introduction of steam-vessels. When I
arrived in 1850, a middle-sized one could be bought pretty readily
for ninepence, but when I left in 1859, they were with difficulty
obtained at eight and nine shillings each. The abundance of
turtles, or rather the facility with which they can be found and
caught, varies with the amount of annual subsidence of the waters.
When the river sinks less than the average, they are scarce; but
when more, they can be caught in plenty, the bays and shallow
lagoons in the forest having then only a small depth of water. The
flesh is very tender, palatable, and wholesome; but it is very
cloying: every one ends, sooner or later, by becoming thoroughly
surfeited. I became so sick of turtle in the course of two years
that I could not bear the smell of it, although at the same time
nothing else was to be had, and I was suffering actual hunger. The
native women cook it in various ways. The entrails are chopped up
and made into a delicious soup called <i>sarapatel</i>, which is
generally boiled in the concave upper shell of the animal used as a
kettle. The tender flesh of the breast is partially minced with
farinha, and the breast shell then roasted over the fire, making a
very pleasant dish. Steaks cut from the breast and cooked with the
fat form another palatable dish. Large sausages are made of the
thick-coated stomach, which is filled with minced meat and boiled.
The quarters cooked in a kettle of Tucup&iacute; sauce form another
variety of food. When surfeited with turtle in all other shapes,
pieces of the lean part roasted on a spit and moistened only with
vinegar make an agreeable change. The smaller kind of turtle, the
tracaja, which makes its appearance in the main river, and lays its
eggs a month earlier than the large species, is of less utility to
the inhabitants although its flesh is superior, on account of the
difficulty of keeping it alive; it survives captivity but a very
few days, although placed in the same ponds in which the large
turtle keeps well for two or three years.</p>

<p>Those who cannot hunt and fish for themselves, and whose
stomachs refuse turtle, are in a poor way at Ega. Fish, including
many kinds of large and delicious salmonid&aelig;, is abundant in
the fine season; but each family fishes only for itself, and has no
surplus for sale. An Indian fisherman remains out just long enough
to draw what he thinks sufficient for a couple of days&rsquo;
consumption. Vacca marina is a great resource in the wet season. It
is caught by harpooning, which requires much skill, or by strong
nets made of very thick hammock twine, and placed across narrow
inlets. Very few Europeans are able to eat the meat of this animal.
Although there is a large quantity of cattle in the neighbourhood
of the town, and pasture is abundant all the year round, beef can
be had only when a beast is killed by accident. The most frequent
cause of death is poisoning by drinking raw Tucup&iacute;, the
juice of the mandioca root. Bowls of this are placed on the ground
in the sheds where the women prepare farinha; it is generally done
carelessly, but sometimes intentionally through spite when stray
oxen devastate the plantations of the poorer people. The juice is
almost certain to be drunk if cattle stray near the place, and
death is the certain result. The owners kill a beast which shows
symptoms of having been poisoned, and retail the beef in the town.
Although every one knows it cannot be wholesome, such is the
scarcity of meat and the uncontrollable desire to eat beef, that it
is eagerly bought, at least by those residents who come from other
provinces where beef is the staple article of food. Game of all
kinds is scarce in the forest near the town, except in the months
of June and July, when immense numbers of a large and handsome
bird, Cuvier&rsquo;s toucan (Ramphastos Cuvieri) make their
appearance. They come in well-fed condition, and are shot in such
quantities that every family has the strange treat of stewed and
roasted toucans daily for many weeks. Curassow birds are plentiful
on the banks of the Solimoens, but to get a brace or two requires
the sacrifice of several days for the trip. A tapir, of which the
meat is most delicious and nourishing, is sometimes killed by a
fortunate hunter. I have still a lively recollection of the
pleasant effects which I once experienced from a diet of fresh
tapir meat for a few days, after having been brought to a painful
state of bodily and mental depression by a month&rsquo;s scanty
rations of fish and farinha.</p>

<p>We sometimes had fresh bread at Ega made from American flour
brought from Par&aacute;, but it was sold at ninepence a pound. I
was once two years without tasting wheaten bread, and attribute
partly to this the gradual deterioration of health which I suffered
on the Upper Amazons. Mandioca meal is a poor, weak substitute for
bread; it is deficient in gluten, and consequently cannot be formed
into a leavened mass or loaf, but is obliged to be roasted in hard
grains in order to keep any length of time. Cakes are made of the
half-roasted meal, but they become sour in a very few hours. A
superior kind of meal is manufactured at Ega of the sweet mandioca
(Manihot Aypi); it is generally made with a mixture of the starch
of the root and is therefore a much more wholesome article of food
than the ordinary sort which, on the Amazons, is made of the pulp
after the starch has been extracted by soaking in water. When we
could get neither bread nor biscuit, I found tapioca soaked in
coffee the best native substitute. We were seldom without butter,
as every canoe brought one or two casks on each return voyage from
Par&aacute;, where it is imported in considerable quantity from
Liverpool. We obtained tea in the same way; it being served as a
fashionable luxury at wedding and christening parties; the people
were at first strangers to this article, for they used to stew it
in a saucepan, mixing it up with coarse raw sugar, and stirring it
with a spoon. Sometimes we had milk, but this was only when a cow
calved; the yield from each cow was very small, and lasted only for
a few weeks in each case, although the pasture is good, and the
animals are sleek and fat.</p>

<img src="images/fig24.jpg" width="106" height="105" alt=
"Uik&iacute; Fruit." align="right">

<p>Fruit of the ordinary tropical sorts could generally be had. I
was quite surprised at the variety of the wild kinds, and of the
delicious flavour of some of them. Many of these are utterly
unknown in the regions nearer the Atlantic, being the peculiar
productions of this highly favoured, and little known, interior
country. Some have been planted by the natives in their clearings.
The best was the <i>Jabut&iacute;-p&uacute;he</i>, or
tortoise-foot; a scaled fruit probably of the Anonaceous order. It
is about the size of an ordinary apple; when ripe the rind is
moderately thin, and encloses, with the seeds, a quantity of
custardy pulp of a very rich flavour. Next to this stands the
Cum&aacute; (Collophora sp.) of which there are two species, not
unlike in appearance, small round pears; but the rind is rather
hard, and contains a gummy milk, and the pulpy part is almost as
delicious as that of the Jabut&iacute;-p&uacute;he. The Cum&aacute;
tree is of moderate height, and grows rather plentifully in the
more elevated and drier situations. A third kind is the
Pam&aacute;, which is a stone fruit, similar in colour and
appearance to the cherry but of oblong shape. The tree is one of
the loftiest in the forest, and has never, I believe, been selected
for cultivation. To get at the fruit the natives are obliged to
climb to the height of about a hundred feet, and cut off the
heavily laden branches. I have already mentioned the Umar&iacute;
and the Wish&iacute;: both these are now cultivated. The fatty,
bitter pulp which surrounds the large stony seeds of these fruits
is eaten mixed with farinha, and is very nourishing. Another
cultivated fruit is the Purum&aacute; (Puruma cecropi&aelig;folia,
Martius), a round juicy berry, growing in large bunches and
resembling grapes in taste. Another smaller kind, called
Purum&aacute;-i, grows wild in the forest close to Ega, and has not
yet been planted. The most singular of all these fruits is the
Uik&iacute;, which is of oblong shape, and grows apparently
crosswise on the end of its stalk. When ripe, the thick green rind
opens by a natural cleft across the middle, and discloses an oval
seed the size of a damascene plum, but of a vivid crimson colour.
This bright hue belongs to a thin coating of pulp which, when the
seeds are mixed in a plate of stewed bananas, gives to the mess a
pleasant rosy tint, and a rich creamy taste and consistence. <i>
Mingua</i> (porridge) of bananas flavoured and coloured with
Uik&iacute; is a favourite dish at Ega. The fruit, like most of the
others here mentioned, ripens in January. Many smaller fruits such
as Wajur&uacute; (probably a species of Achras), the size of a
gooseberry, which grows singly and contains a sweet gelatinous
pulp, enclosing two large, shining black seeds;
Caship&aacute;ri-arapa&aacute;, an oblong scarlet berry; two kinds
of Bacur&iacute;, the Bacur&iacute;-si&uacute;ma and the B.
cur&uacute;a, sour fruits of a bright lemon colour when ripe, and a
great number of others, are of less importance as articles of
food.</p>

<p>The celebrated &ldquo;Peach palm,&rdquo; <i>Pupunha</i> of the
Tup&iacute; nations (Guilielma speciosa), is a common tree at Ega.
The name, I suppose, is in allusion to the colour of the fruit, and
not to its flavour, for it is dry and mealy, and in taste may be
compared to a mixture of chestnuts and cheese. Vultures devour it
eagerly, and come in quarrelsome flocks to the trees when it is
ripe. Dogs will also eat it: I do not recollect seeing cats do the
same, although they go voluntarily to the woods to eat
Tucum&aacute;, another kind of palm fruit. The tree, as it grows in
clusters beside the palm-thatched huts, is a noble ornament, being,
when full grown, from fifty to sixty feet in height and often as
straight as a scaffold-pole. A bunch of fruit when ripe is a load
for a strong man, and each tree bears several of them. The Pupunha
grows wild nowhere on the Amazons. It is one of those few vegetable
productions (including three kinds of mandioca and the American
species of banana) which the Indians have cultivated from time
immemorial, and brought with them in their original migration to
Brazil. It is only, however, the more advanced tribes who have kept
up the cultivation. The superiority of the fruit on the Solimoens
to that grown on the Lower Amazons and in the neighbourhood of
Par&aacute; is very striking. At Ega it is generally as large as a
full-sized peach, and when boiled, almost as mealy as a potato;
whilst at Par&aacute; it is no bigger than a walnut, and the pulp
is fibrous. Bunches of sterile or seedless fruits sometimes occur
in both districts. It is one of the principal articles of food at
Ega when in season, and is boiled and eaten with treacle or salt. A
dozen of the seedless fruits makes a good nourishing meal for a
grown-up person. It is the general belief that there is more
nutriment in Pupunha than in fish or Vacca marina.</p>

<img src="images/fig25.jpg" width="215" height="448" alt=

<p>The seasons in the Upper Amazons region offer some points of
difference from those of the lower river and the district of
Par&aacute;, which two sections of the country we have already seen
also differ considerably. The year at Ega is divided according to
the rises and falls of the river, with which coincide the wet and
dry periods. All the principal transactions of life of the
inhabitants are regulated by these yearly recurring phenomena. The
peculiarity of this upper region consists in there being two rises
and two falls within the year. The great annual rise commences
about the end of February and continues to the middle of June,
during which the rivers and lakes, confined during the dry periods
to their ordinary beds, gradually swell and overflow all the lower
lands. The inundation progresses gently inch by inch, and is felt
everywhere, even in the interior of the forests of the higher
lands, miles away from the river; as these are traversed by
numerous gullies, forming in the fine season dry, spacious dells,
which become gradually transformed by the pressure of the flood
into broad creeks navigable by small boats under the shade of
trees. All the countless swarms of turtle of various species then
leave the main river for the inland pools; the sand-banks go under
water, and the flocks of wading birds migrate north to the upper
waters of the tributaries which flow from that direction, or to the
Orinoco; which streams during the wet period of the Amazons are
enjoying the cloudless skies of their dry season. The families of
fishermen who have been employed during the previous four or five
months in harpooning and salting pirarucu and shooting turtle in
the great lakes, now return to the towns and villages; their
temporarily constructed fishing establishments becoming gradually
submerged with the sand islets or beaches on which they were
situated. This is the season, however, in which the Brazil nut and
wild cacao ripen, and many persons go out to gather these harvests,
remaining absent generally throughout the months of March and
April. The rains during this time are not continuous; they fall
very heavily at times, but rarely last so long at a stretch as
twenty-four hours, and many days intervene of pleasant, sunny
weather. The sky, however, is generally overcast and gloomy, and
sometimes a drizzling rain falls.</p>

<p>About the first week in June the flood is at its highest; the
water being then about forty-five feet above its lowest point; but
it varies in different years to the extent of about fifteen feet.
The &ldquo;enchente,&rdquo; or flow, as it is called by the
natives, who believe this great annual movement of the waters to be
of the same nature as the tide towards the mouth of the Amazons, is
then completed, and all begin to look forward to the
&ldquo;vasante,&rdquo; or ebb. The provision made for the dearth of
the wet season is by this time pretty nearly exhausted; fish is
difficult to procure and many of the less provident inhabitants
have become reduced to a diet of fruits and farinha porridge.</p>

<p>The fine season begins with a few days of brilliant
weather&mdash;furious, hot sun, with passing clouds. Idle men and
women, tired of the dullness and confinement of the flood season,
begin to report, on returning from their morning bath, the
cessation of the flow: <i>as agoas estao paradas</i>, &ldquo;the
waters have stopped.&rdquo; The muddy streets, in a few days, dry
up; groups of young fellows are now seen seated on the shady sides
of the cottages making arrows and knitting fishing-nets with tucum
twine; others are busy patching up and caulking their canoes, large
and small; in fact, preparations are made on all sides for the much
longed-for &ldquo;verao,&rdquo; or summer, and the
&ldquo;migration,&rdquo; as it is called, of fish and turtle; that
is, their descent from the inaccessible pools in the forest to the
main river. Towards the middle of July, the sand-banks begin to
reappear above the surface of the waters, and with this change come
flocks of sandpipers and gulls, which latter make known the advent
of the fine season, as the cuckoo does of the European spring;
uttering almost incessantly their plaintive cries as they fly about
over the shallow waters of sandy shores. Most of the gaily-plumaged
birds have now finished moulting, and begin to be more active in
the forest.</p>

<p>The fall continues to the middle of October, with the
interruption of a partial rise called &ldquo;repiquet&rdquo; of a
few inches in the midst of very dry weather in September, caused by
the swollen contribution of some large affluent higher up the
river. The amount of subsidence also varies considerably, but it is
never so great as to interrupt navigation by large vessels. The
greater it is the more abundant is the season. Everyone is
prosperous when the waters are low; the shallow bays and pools
being then crowded with the concentrated population of fish and
turtle. All the people, men, women, and children, leave the
villages and spend the few weeks of glorious weather rambling over
the vast undulating expanses of sand in the middle of the
Solimoens, fishing, hunting, collecting eggs of turtle and plovers
and thoroughly enjoying themselves. The inhabitants pray always for
a &ldquo;vasante grande,&rdquo; or great ebb.</p>

<p>From the middle of October to the beginning of January, the
second wet season prevails. The rise is sometimes not more than
about fifteen feet, but it is, in some years, much more extensive,
laying the large sand islands under water before the turtle eggs
are hatched. In one year, whilst I resided at Ega, this second
annual inundation reached to within ten feet of the highest water
point as marked by the stains on the trunks of trees by the river
side.</p>

<p>The second dry season comes on in January, and lasts throughout
February. The river sinks sometimes to the extent of a few feet
only, but one year (1856) I saw it ebb to within about five feet of
its lowest point in September. This is called the summer of the
Umar&iacute;, &ldquo;Vera&oacute; do Umar&iacute;,&rdquo; after the
fruit of this name already described, which ripens at this season.
When the fall is great, this is the best time to catch turtles. In
the year above mentioned, nearly all the residents who had a canoe,
and could work a paddle, went out after them in the month of
February, and about 2000 were caught in the course of a few days.
It appears that they had been arrested in their migration towards
the interior pools of the forest by the sudden drying up of the
water-courses, and so had become easy prey.</p>

<p>Thus the Ega year is divided into four seasons; two of dry
weather and falling waters, and two of the reverse. Besides this
variety, there is, in the month of May, a short season of very cold
weather, a most surprising circumstance in this otherwise uniformly
sweltering climate. This is caused by the continuance of a cold
wind, which blows from the south over the humid forests that extend
without interruption from north of the equator to the eighteenth
parallel of latitude in Bolivia. I had, unfortunately, no
thermometer with me at Ega; the only one I brought with me from
England having been lost at Par&aacute;. The temperature is so much
lowered that fishes die in the river Teffe, and are cast in
considerable quantities on its shores. The wind is not strong, but
it brings cloudy weather, and lasts from three to five or six days
in each year. The inhabitants all suffer much from the cold, many
of them wrapping themselves up with the warmest clothing they can
get (blankets are here unknown), and shutting themselves indoors
with a charcoal fire lighted. I found, myself, the change of
temperature most delightful, and did not require extra clothing. It
was a bad time, however, for my pursuit, as birds and insects all
betook themselves to places of concealment, and remained inactive.
The period during which this wind prevails is called the
&ldquo;tempo da friagem,&rdquo; or the season of coldness. The
phenomenon, I presume, is to be accounted for by the fact that in
May it is winter in the southern temperate zone, and that the cool
currents of air travelling thence northwards towards the equator
become only moderately heated in their course, owing to the
intermediate country being a vast, partially-flooded plain covered
with humid forests.</p>
