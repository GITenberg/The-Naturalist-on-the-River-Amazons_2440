<p class="first">As may have been gathered from the remarks
already made, the neighbourhood of Ega was a fine field for a
Natural History collector. With the exception of what could be
learned from the few specimens brought home, after transient
visits by Spix and Martius and the Count de Castelnau, whose
acquisitions have been deposited in the public museums of Munich
and Paris, very little was known in Europe of the animal tenants
of this region; the collections that I had the opportunity of
making and sending home attracted, therefore, considerable
attention. Indeed, the name of my favourite village has become
quite a household word amongst a numerous class of Naturalists,
not only in England but abroad, in consequence of the very large
number of new species (upwards of 3000) which they have had to
describe, with the locality &ldquo;Ega&rdquo; attached to them.
The discovery of new species, however, forms but a small item in
the interest belonging to the study of the living creation. The
structure, habits, instincts, and geographical distribution of
some of the oldest-known forms supply inexhaustible materials for
reflection. The few remarks I have to make on the animals of Ega
will relate to the mammals, birds, and insects, and will sometimes
apply to the productions of the whole Upper Amazons region. We
will begin with the monkeys, the most interesting, next to man, of
all animals.</p>
<p>
<i>Scarlet-faced Monkeys.</i>&mdash;Early one sunny morning, in the
year 1855, I saw in the streets of Ega a number of Indians,
carrying on their shoulders down to the port, to be embarked on
the Upper Amazons steamer, a large cage made of strong lianas,
some twelve feet in length and five in height, containing a dozen
monkeys of the most grotesque appearance. Their bodies (about
eighteen inches in height, exclusive of limbs) were clothed from
neck to tail with very long, straight, and shining whitish hair;
their heads were nearly bald, owing to the very short crop of thin
grey hairs, and their faces glowed with the most vivid scarlet
hue. As a finish to their striking physiognomy, they had bushy
whiskers of a sandy colour, meeting under the chin, and
reddish-yellow eyes. These red-faced apes belonged to a species
called by the Indians Uakar&iacute;, which is peculiar to the Ega
district, and the cage with its contents was being sent as a
present by Senhor Chrysostomo, the Director of Indians of the
Japura, to one of the Government officials at Rio Janeiro, in
acknowledgment of having been made colonel of the new National
Guard. They had been obtained with great difficulty in the forests
which cover the lowlands near the principal mouth of the Japura,
about thirty miles from Ega. It was the first time I had seen this
most curious of all the South American monkeys, and one that
appears to have escaped the notice of Spix and Martius. I
afterwards made a journey to the district inhabited by it, but did
not then succeed in obtaining specimens; before leaving the
country, however, I acquired two individuals, one of which lived
in my house for several weeks.</p><br>

<center><img src="images/fig32.jpg" width="261" height="435" alt=
"Scarlet-faced and Parauac&uacute; Monkeys."></center>

<p>
The scarlet-faced monkey belongs, in all essential points of
structure, to the same family (Cebid&aelig;) as the rest of the
large-sized American species; but it differs from all its
relatives in having only the rudiment of a tail, a member which
reaches in some allied kinds the highest grade of development
known in the order. It was so unusual to see a nearly tailless
monkey from America, that naturalists thought, when the first
specimens arrived in Europe, that the member had been shortened
artificially. Nevertheless, the Uakar&iacute; is not quite
isolated from its related species of the same family, several
other kinds, also found on the Amazons, forming a graduated
passage between the extreme forms as regards the tail. The
appendage reaches its perfection in those genera (the Howlers, the
Lagothrix and the Spider monkeys) in which it presents on its
under-surface near the tip a naked palm, which makes it sensitive
and useful as a fifth hand in climbing. In the rest of the genera
of Cebid&aelig; (seven in number, containing thirty-eight
species), the tail is weaker in structure, entirely covered with
hair, and of little or no service in climbing, a few species
nearly related to our Uakar&iacute; having it much shorter than
usual. All the Cebid&aelig;, both long-tailed and short-tailed,
are equally dwellers in trees. The scarlet-faced monkey lives in
forests, which are inundated during great part of the year, and is
never known to descend to the ground; the shortness of its tail
is, therefore, no sign of terrestrial habits, as it is in the
Macaques and Baboons of the Old World. It differs a little from
the typical Cebid&aelig; in its teeth, the incisors being oblique
and, in the upper jaw, converging, so as to leave a gap between
the outermost and the canine teeth. Like all the rest of its
family, it differs from the monkeys of the Old World, and from
man, in having an additional grinding-tooth (premolar) in each
side of both jaws, making the complete set thirty-six instead of
thirty-two in number.</p>
<p>
The white Uakar&iacute; (Brachyurus calvus), seems to be found
in no other part of America than the district just mentioned,
namely, the banks of the Japura, near its principal mouth; and
even there it is confined, as far I could learn, to the western
side of the river. It lives in small troops amongst the crowns of
the lofty trees, subsisting on fruits of various kinds. Hunters
say it is pretty nimble in its motions, but is not much given to
leaping, preferring to run up and down the larger boughs in
travelling from tree to tree. The mother, as in other species of
the monkey order, carries her young on her back. Individuals are
obtained alive by shooting them with the blow-pipe and arrows
tipped with diluted Urar&iacute; poison. They run a considerable
distance after being pierced, and it requires an experienced
hunter to track them. He is considered the most expert who can
keep pace with a wounded one, and catch it in his arms when it
falls exhausted. A pinch of salt, the antidote to the poison, is
then put in its mouth, and the creature revives. The species is
rare, even in the limited district which it inhabits. Senhor
Chrysostomo sent six of his most skilful Indians, who were absent
three weeks before they obtained the twelve specimens which formed
his unique and princely gift. When an independent hunter obtains
one, a very high price (thirty to forty milreis<sup><a
href="#1">1</a></sup>) is asked, these monkeys being in great
demand for presents to persons of influence down the river.</p>
<p>
Adult Uakar&iacute;s, caught in the way just described, very
rarely become tame. They are peevish and sulky, resisting all
attempts to coax them, and biting anyone who ventures within
reach. They have no particular cry, even when in their native
woods; in captivity they are quite silent. In the course of a few
days or weeks, if not very carefully attended to, they fall into a
listless condition, refuse food, and die. Many of them succumb to
a disease which I suppose from the symptoms to be inflammation of
the chest or lungs. The one which I kept as a pet died of this
disorder after I had had it about three weeks. It lost its
appetite in a very few days, although kept in an airy verandah;
its coat, which was originally long, smooth, and glossy, became
dingy and ragged like that of the specimens seen in museums, and
the bright scarlet colour of its face changed to a duller hue.
This colour, in health, is spread over the features up to the
roots of the hair on the forehead and temples, and down to the
neck, including the flabby cheeks which hang down below the jaws.
The animal, in this condition, looks at a short distance as though
some one had laid a thick coat of red paint on its countenance.
The death of my pet was slow; during the last twenty-four hours it
lay prostrate, breathing quickly, its chest strongly heaving; the
colour of its face became gradually paler, but was still red when
it expired. As the hue did not quite disappear until two or three
hours after the animal was quite dead, I judged that it was not
exclusively due to the blood, but partly to a pigment beneath the
skin which would probably retain its colour a short time after the
circulation had ceased.</p>
<p>
After seeing much of the morose disposition of the
Uakar&iacute;, I was not a little surprised one day at a
friend&rsquo;s house to find an extremely lively and familiar
individual of this species. It ran from an inner chamber straight
towards me after I had sat down on a chair, climbed my legs and
nestled in my lap, turning round and looking up with the usual
monkey&rsquo;s grin, after it had made itself comfortable. It was
a young animal which had been taken when its mother was shot with
a poisoned arrow; its teeth were incomplete, and the face was pale
and mottled, the glowing scarlet hue not supervening in these
animals before mature age; it had also a few long black hairs on
the eyebrows and lips. The frisky little fellow had been reared in
the house amongst the children, and allowed to run about freely,
and take its meals with the rest of the household. There are few
animals which the Brazilians of these villages have not succeeded
in taming. I have even seen young jaguars running loose about a
house, and treated as pets. The animals that I had rarely became
familiar, however long they might remain in my possession, a
circumstance due no doubt to their being kept always tied up.</p>
<p>
The Uakar&iacute; is one of the many species of animals which
are classified by the Brazilians as &ldquo;mort&aacute;l,&rdquo;
or of delicate constitution, in contradistinction to those which
are &ldquo;duro,&rdquo; or hardy. A large proportion of the
specimens sent from Ega die before arriving at Par&aacute;, and
scarcely one in a dozen succeeds in reaching Rio Janeiro alive.
The difficulty it has of accommodating itself to changed
conditions probably has some connection with the very limited
range or confined sphere of life of the species in its natural
state, its native home being an area of swampy woods, not more
than about sixty square miles in extent, although no permanent
barrier exists to check its dispersal, except towards the south,
over a much wider space. When I descended the river in 1859, we
had with us a tame adult Uakar&iacute;, which was allowed to
ramble about the vessel, a large schooner. When we reached the
mouth of the Rio Negro, we had to wait four days whilst the
custom-house officials at Barra, ten miles distant, made out the
passports for our crew, and during this time the schooner lay
close to the shore, with its bowsprit secured to the trees on the
bank. Well, one morning, scarlet-face was missing, having made his
escape into the forest. Two men were sent in search of him, but
returned after several hours&rsquo; absence without having caught
sight of the runaway. We gave up the monkey for lost, until the
following day, when he re-appeared on the skirts of the forest,
and marched quietly down the bowsprit to his usual place on deck.
He had evidently found the forests of the Rio Negro very different
from those of the delta lands of the Japura, and preferred
captivity to freedom in a place that was so uncongenial to him.</p>
<p>
<i>The Parauac&uacute; Monkey.</i>&mdash;Another Ega monkey, nearly
related to the Uakar&iacute;s, is the Parauac&uacute; (Pithecia
hirsuta), a timid inoffensive creature with a long bear-like coat
of harsh speckled-grey hair. The long fur hangs over the head,
half concealing the pleasing diminutive face, and clothes also the
tail to the tip, which member is well developed, being eighteen
inches in length, or longer than the body. The Parauac&uacute; is
found on the &ldquo;terra firma&rdquo; lands of the north shore of
the Solimoens from Tunantins to Peru. It exists also on the south
side of the river, namely, on the banks of the Teff&eacute;, but
there under a changed form, which differs a little from its type
in colours. This form has been described by Dr. Gray as a distinct
species, under the name of Pithecia albicans. The Parauac&uacute;
is also a very delicate animal, rarely living many weeks in
captivity; but any one who succeeds in keeping it alive for a
month or two, gains by it a most affectionate pet. One of the
specimens of Pithecia albicans now in the British Museum was, when
living, the property of a young Frenchman, a neighbour of mine at
Ega. It became so tame in the course of a few weeks that it
followed him about the streets like a dog. My friend was a tailor,
and the little pet used to spend the greater part of the day
seated on his shoulder, whilst he was at work on his board.
Nevertheless, it showed great dislike to strangers, and was not on
good terms with any other member of my friend&rsquo;s household
than himself. I saw no monkey that showed so strong a personal
attachment as this gentle, timid, silent, little creature. The
eager and passionate Cebi seem to take the lead of all the South
American monkeys in intelligence and docility, and the
Coait&aacute; has perhaps the most gentle and impressible
disposition; but the Parauac&uacute;, although a dull, cheerless
animal, excels all in this quality of capability of attachment to
individuals of our own species. It is not wanting, however, in
intelligence as well as moral goodness, proof of which was
furnished one day by an act of our little pet. My neighbour had
quitted his house in the morning without taking Parauac&uacute;
with him, and the little creature having missed its friend, and
concluded, as it seemed, that he would be sure to come to me, both
being in the habit of paying me a daily visit together, came
straight to my dwelling, taking a short cut over gardens, trees,
and thickets, instead of going the roundabout way of the street.
It had never done this before, and we knew the route it had taken
only from a neighbour having watched its movements. On arriving at
my house and not finding its master, it climbed to the top of my
table, and sat with an air of quiet resignation waiting for him.
Shortly afterwards my friend entered, and the gladdened pet then
jumped to its usual perch on his shoulder.</p>
<p>
<i>Owl-faced Night Apes.</i>&mdash;A third interesting genus of
monkeys found near Ega, are the Nyctipitheci, or night apes,
called Ei-&aacute; by the Indians. Of these I found two species,
closely related to each other but nevertheless quite distinct, as
both inhabit the same forests, namely, those of the higher and
drier lands, without mingling with each other or intercrossing.
They sleep all day long in hollow trees, and come forth to prey on
insects and eat fruits only in the night. They are of small size,
the body being about a foot long, and the tail fourteen inches,
and are thickly clothed with soft grey and brown fur, similar in
substance to that of the rabbit. Their physiognomy reminds one of
an owl, or tiger-cat: the face is round and encircled by a ruff of
whitish fur; the muzzle is not at all prominent; the mouth and
chin are small; the ears are very short, scarcely appearing above
the hair of the head; and the eyes are large and yellowish in
colour, imparting the staring expression of nocturnal animals of
prey. The forehead is whitish, and decorated with three black
stripes, which in one of the species (Nyctipithecus trivirgatus)
continue to the crown; and in the other (N. felinus), meet on the
top of the forehead. N. trivirgatus was first described by
Humboldt, who discovered it on the banks of the Cassiquiare, near
the head waters of the Rio Negro.</p>
<p>
I kept a pet animal of the N. trivirgatus for many months, a
young one having been given to me by an Indian <i>compadre</i>, as
a present from my newly-baptised godson. These monkeys, although
sleeping by day, are aroused by the least noise; so that, when a
person passes by a tree in which a number of them are concealed,
he is startled by the sudden apparition of a group of little
striped faces crowding a hole in the trunk. It was in this way
that my compadre discovered the colony from which the one given to
me was taken. I was obliged to keep my pet chained up; it
therefore, never became thoroughly familiar. I once saw, however,
an individual of the other species (N. felinus) which was most
amusingly tame. It was as lively and nimble as the Cebi, but not
so mischievous and far more confiding in its disposition,
delighting to be caressed by all persons who came into the house.
But its owner, the Municipal Judge of Ega, Dr. Carlos Mariana, had
treated it for many weeks with the greatest kindness, allowing it
to sleep with him at night in his hammock, and to nestle in his
bosom half the day as he lay reading. It was a great favourite
with everyone, from the cleanliness of its habits to the
prettiness of its features and ways. My own pet was kept in a box,
in which was placed a broad-mouthed glass jar; into this it would
dive, head foremost, when any one entered the room, turning round
inside, and thrusting forth its inquisitive face an instant
afterwards to stare at the intruder. It was very active at night,
venting at frequent intervals a hoarse cry, like the suppressed
barking of a dog, and scampering about the room, to the length of
its tether, after cockroaches and spiders. In climbing between the
box and the wall, it straddled the space, resting its hands on the
palms and tips of the out-stretched fingers with the knuckles bent
at an acute angle, and thus mounted to the top with the greatest
facility. Although seeming to prefer insects, it ate all kinds of
fruit, but would not touch raw or cooked meat, and was very seldom
thirsty. I was told by persons who had kept these monkeys loose
about the house, that they cleared the chambers of bats as well as
insect vermin. When approached gently my Ei-&aacute; allowed
itself to be caressed; but when handled roughly, it always took
alarm, biting severely, striking out its little hands, and making
a hissing noise like a cat. As already related, my pet was killed
by a jealous Caiar&aacute;ra monkey, which was kept in the house
at the same time.</p>
<p>
<i>Barrigudo Monkeys.</i>&mdash;Ten other species of monkeys were
found, in addition to those already mentioned, in the forests of
the Upper Amazons. All were strictly arboreal and diurnal in their
habits, and lived in flocks, travelling from tree to tree, the
mothers with their children on their backs; leading, in fact, a
life similar to that of the Par&aacute;rau&aacute;te Indians, and,
like them, occasionally plundering the plantations which lie near
their line of march. Some of them were found also on the Lower
Amazons, and have been noticed in former chapters of this
narrative. Of the remainder, the most remarkable is the Macaco
barrigudo, or bag-bellied monkey of the Portuguese colonists, a
species of Lagothrix. The genus is closely allied to the
Coait&aacute;s, or spider monkeys, having, like them, exceedingly
strong and flexible tails, which are furnished underneath with a
naked palm like a hand, for grasping. The Barrigudos, however, are
very bulky animals, whilst the spider monkeys are remarkable for
the slenderness of their bodies and limbs. I obtained specimens of
what have been considered two species, one (L. olivaceus of Spix?)
having the head clothed with grey, the other (L. Humboldtii) with
black fur. They both live together in the same places, and are
probably only differently-coloured individuals of one and the same
species. I sent home a very large male of one of these kinds,
which measured twenty-seven inches in length of trunk, the tail
being twenty-six inches long; it was the largest monkey I saw in
America, with the exception of a black Howler, whose body was
twenty-eight inches in height. The skin of the face in the
Barrigudo is black and wrinkled, the forehead is low, with the
eyebrows projecting, and, in short, the features altogether
resemble in a striking manner those of an old negro. In the
forests, the Barrigudo is not a very active animal; it lives
exclusively on fruits, and is much persecuted by the Indians, on
account of the excellence of its flesh as food. From information
given me by a collector of birds and mammals, whom I employed, and
who resided a long time amongst the Tucuna Indians near Tabatinga,
I calculated that one horde of this tribe, 200 in number,
destroyed 1200 of these monkeys annually for food. The species is
very numerous in the forests of the higher lands, but, owing to
long persecution, it is now seldom seen in the neighbourhood of
the larger villages. It is not found at all on the Lower Amazons.
Its manners in captivity are grave, and its temper mild and
confiding, like that of the Coait&aacute;s. Owing to these traits,
the Barrigudo is much sought after for pets; but it is not hardy
like the Coait&aacute;s, and seldom survives a passage down the
river to Par&aacute;.</p>
<p>
<i>Marmosets.</i>&mdash;It now only remains to notice the Marmosets,
which form the second family of American monkeys. Our old friend
Midas ursulus, of Par&aacute; and the Lower Amazons, is not found
on the Upper river, but in its stead a closely-allied species
presents itself, which appears to be the Midas rufoniger of
Gervais, whose mouth is bordered with longish white hairs. The
habits of this species are the same as those of the M. ursulus,
indeed it seems probable that it is a form or race of the same
stock, modified to suit the altered local conditions under which
it lives. One day, whilst walking along a forest pathway, I saw
one of these lively little fellows miss his grasp as he was
passing from one tree to another along with his troop. He fell
head foremost, from a height of at least fifty feet, but managed
cleverly to alight on his legs in the pathway, quickly turning
around, gave me a good stare for a few moments, and then bounded
off gaily to climb another tree. At Tunantins, I shot a pair of a
very handsome species of Marmoset, the M. rufiventer, I believe,
of zoologists. Its coat was very glossy and smooth, the back deep
brown, and the underside of the body of rich black and reddish
hues. A third species (found at Tabatinga, 200 miles further west)
is of a deep black colour, with the exception of a patch of white
hair around its mouth. The little animal, at a short distance,
looks as though it held a ball of snow-white cotton in its teeth.
The last I shall mention is the Hapale pygm&aelig;us, one of the
most diminutive forms of the monkey order, three full-grown
specimens of which, measuring only seven inches in length of body,
I obtained near St. Paulo. The pretty Lilliputian face is
furnished with long brown whiskers, which are naturally brushed
back over the ears. The general colour of the animal is
brownish-tawny, but the tail is elegantly barred with black. I was
surprised, on my return to England, to learn from specimens in the
British Museum, that the pigmy Marmoset was found also in Mexico,
no other Amazonian monkey being known to wander far from the great
river plain. Thus, the smallest and apparently the feeblest,
species of the whole order, is one which has, by some means,
become the most widely dispersed.</p>
<p>
<i>The Jupur&aacute;.</i>&mdash;A curious animal, known to
naturalists as the Kinkajou, but called Jupur&aacute; by the
Indians of the Amazons, and considered by them as a kind of
monkey, may be mentioned in this place. It is the Cercoleptes
caudivolvus of zoologists, and has been considered by some authors
as an intermediate form between the Lemur family of apes and the
plantigrade Carnivora, or Bear family. It has decidedly no close
relationship to either of the groups of American monkeys, having
six cutting teeth to each jaw, and long claws instead of nails,
with extremities of the usual shape of paws instead of hands. Its
muzzle is conical and pointed, like that of many Lemurs of
Madagascar; the expression of its countenance, and its habits and
actions, are also very similar to those of Lemurs. Its tail is
very flexible towards the tip, and is used to twine round branches
in climbing. I did not see or hear anything of this animal whilst
residing on the Lower Amazons, but on the banks of the Upper
river, from the Teff&eacute; to Peru, it appeared to be rather
common. It is nocturnal in its habits, like the owl-faced monkeys,
although, unlike them, it has a bright, dark eye. I once saw it in
considerable numbers, when on an excursion with an Indian
companion along the low Ygap&oacute; shores of the Teff&eacute;,
about twenty miles above Ega. We slept one night at the house of a
native family living in the thick of the forest where a festival
was going on and, there being no room to hang our hammocks under
shelter, on account of the number of visitors, we lay down on a
mat in the open air, near a shed which stood in the midst of a
grove of fruit-trees and pupunha palms. Past midnight, when all
became still, after the uproar of holiday-making, as I was
listening to the dull, fanning sound made by the wings of impish
hosts of vampire bats crowding round the Caj&uacute; trees, a
rustle commenced from the side of the woods, and a troop of
slender, long-tailed animals were seen against the clear moonlit
sky, taking flying leaps from branch to branch through the grove.
Many of them stopped at the pupunha trees, and the hustling,
twittering, and screaming, with sounds of falling fruits, showed
how they were employed. I thought, at first, they were
Nyctipitheci, but they proved to be Jupur&aacute;s, for the owner
of the house early next morning caught a young one, and gave it to
me. I kept this as a pet animal for several weeks, feeding it on
bananas and mandioca-meal mixed with treacle. It became tame in a
very short time, allowing itself to be caressed, but making a
distinction in the degree of confidence it showed between myself
and strangers. My pet was unfortunately killed by a
neighbour&rsquo;s dog, which entered the room where it was kept.
The animal is so difficult to obtain alive, its place of retreat
in the daytime not being known to the natives, that I was unable
to procure a second living specimen.</p>
<p>
<i>Bats.</i>&mdash;The only other mammals that I shall mention are
the bats, which exist in very considerable numbers and variety in
the forest, as well as in the buildings of the villages. Many
small and curious species, living in the woods, conceal themselves
by day under the broad leaf-blades of Heliconi&aelig; and other
plants which grow in shady places; others cling to the trunks of
trees. Whilst walking through the forest in the daytime,
especially along gloomy ravines, one is almost sure to startle
bats from their sleeping-places; and at night they are often seen
in great numbers flitting about the trees on the shady margins of
narrow channels. I captured altogether, without giving especial
attention to bats, sixteen different species at Ega.</p>
<p>
<i>The Vampire Bat.</i>&mdash;The little grey blood-sucking
Phyllostoma, mentioned in a former chapter as found in my chamber
at Carip&iacute;, was not uncommon at Ega, where everyone believes
it to visit sleepers and bleed them in the night. But the vampire
was here by far the most abundant of the family of leaf-nosed
bats. It is the largest of all the South American species,
measuring twenty-eight inches in expanse of wing. Nothing in
animal physiognomy can be more hideous than the countenance of
this creature when viewed from the front; the large, leathery ears
standing out from the sides and top of the head, the erect
spear-shaped appendage on the tip of the nose, the grin and the
glistening black eye, all combining to make up a figure that
reminds one of some mocking imp of fable. No wonder that
imaginative people have inferred diabolical instincts on the part
of so ugly an animal. The vampire, however, is the most harmless
of all bats, and its inoffensive character is well known to
residents on the banks of the Amazons. I found two distinct
species of it, one having the fur of a blackish colour, the other
of a ruddy hue, and ascertained that both feed chiefly on fruits.
The church at Ega was the headquarters of both kinds, I used to
see them, as I sat at my door during the short evening twilights,
trooping forth by scores from a large open window at the back of
the altar, twittering cheerfully as they sped off to the borders
of the forest. They sometimes enter houses; the first time I saw
one in my chamber, wheeling heavily round and round, I mistook it
for a pigeon, thinking that a tame one had escaped from the
premises of one of my neighbours. I opened the stomachs of several
of these bats, and found them to contain a mass of pulp and seeds
of fruits, mingled with a few remains of insects. The natives say
they devour ripe caj&uacute;s and guavas on trees in the gardens,
but on comparing the seeds taken from their stomachs with those of
all cultivated trees at Ega, I found they were unlike any of them;
it is therefore probable that they generally resort to the forest
to feed, coming to the village in the morning to sleep, because
they find it more secure from animals of prey than their natural
abides in the woods.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Birds.</i>&mdash;I have already had occasion to mention
several of the more interesting birds found in the Ega district.
The first thing that would strike a newcomer in the forests of the
Upper Amazons would be the general scarcity of birds; indeed, it
often happened that I did not meet with a single bird during a
whole day&rsquo;s ramble in the richest and most varied parts of
the woods. Yet the country is tenanted by many hundred species,
many of which are, in reality, abundant, and some of them
conspicuous from their brilliant plumage. The cause of their
apparent rarity is to be sought in the sameness and density of the
thousand miles of forest which constitute their dwelling-place.
The birds of the country are gregarious, at least during the
season when they are most readily found; but the frugivorous kinds
are to be met with only when certain wild fruits are ripe, and to
know the exact localities of the trees requires months of
experience. It would not be supposed that the insectivorous birds
are also gregarious; but they are so; numbers of distinct species,
belonging to many different families, joining together in the
chase or search of food. The proceedings of these associated bands
of insect-hunters are not a little curious, and merit a few
remarks.</p>
<p>
Whilst hunting along the narrow pathways that are made through
the forest in the neighbourhood of houses and villages, one may
pass several days without seeing many birds; but now and then the
surrounding bushes and trees appear suddenly to swarm with them.
There are scores, probably hundreds of birds, all moving about
with the greatest activity&mdash;woodpeckers and Dendrocolaptid&aelig;
(from species no larger than a sparrow to others the size of a
crow) running up the tree trunks; tanagers, ant-thrushes,
humming-birds, fly-catchers, and barbets flitting about the leaves
and lower branches. The bustling crowd loses no time, and although
moving in concert, each bird is occupied, on its own account, in
searching bark or leaf or twig; the barbets visit every clayey
nest of termites on the trees which lie in the line of march. In a
few minutes the host is gone, and the forest path remains deserted
and silent as before. I became, in course of time, so accustomed
to this habit of birds in the woods near Ega, that I could
generally find the flock of associated marauders whenever I wanted
it. There appeared to be only one of these flocks in each small
district; and, as it traversed chiefly a limited tract of woods of
second growth, I used to try different paths until I came up with
it.</p>
<p>
The Indians have noticed these miscellaneous hunting parties of
birds, but appear not to have observed that they are occupied in
searching for insects. They have supplied their want of knowledge,
in the usual way of half-civilised people, by a theory which has
degenerated into a myth, to the effect that the onward moving
bands are led by a little grey bird, called the
Uir&aacute;-par&aacute;, which fascinates all the rest, and leads
them a weary dance through the thickets. There is certainly some
appearance of truth in this explanation, for sometimes stray birds
encountered in the line of march, are seen to be drawn into the
throng, and purely frugivorous birds are now and then found mixed
up with the rest, as though led away by some
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp. The native women, even the white and
half-caste inhabitants of the towns, attach a superstitious value
to the skin and feathers of the Uir&aacute;-par&aacute;, believing
that if they keep them in their clothes&rsquo; chest, the relics
will have the effect of attracting for the happy possessors a
train of lovers and followers. These birds are consequently in
great demand in some places, the hunters selling them at a high
price to the foolish girls, who preserve the bodies by drying
flesh and feathers together in the sun. I could never get a sight
of this famous little bird in the forest. I once employed Indians
to obtain specimens for me; but, after the same man (who was a
noted woodsman) brought me, at different times, three distinct
species of birds as the Uir&aacute;-par&aacute;, I gave up the
story as a piece of humbug. The simplest explanation appears to be
this: the birds associate in flocks from the instinct of
self-preservation in order to be a less easy prey to hawks,
snakes, and other enemies than they would be if feeding alone.</p>
<p>
<i>Toucans.&mdash;Cuvier&rsquo;s Toucan.</i>&mdash;Of this family of
birds, so conspicuous from the great size and light structure of
their beaks, and so characteristic of tropical American forests,
five species inhabit the woods of Ega. The commonest is
Cuvier&rsquo;s Toucan, a large bird, distinguished from its
nearest relatives by the feathers at the bottom of the back being
of a saffron hue instead of red. It is found more or less
numerously throughout the year, as it breeds in the neighbourhood,
laying its eggs in holes of trees, at a great height from the
ground. During most months of the year, it is met with in single
individuals or small flocks, and the birds are then very wary.
Sometimes one of these little bands of four or five is seen
perched, for hours together, amongst the topmost branches of high
trees, giving vent to their remarkably loud, shrill, yelping
cries, one bird, mounted higher than the rest, acting, apparently,
as leader of the inharmonious chorus; but two of them are often
heard yelping alternately, and in different notes. These cries
have a vague resemblance to the syllables Toc&aacute;no,
Toc&aacute;no, and hence, the Indian name of this genus of birds.
At these times it is difficult to get a shot at Toucans, for their
senses are so sharpened that they descry the hunter before he gets
near the tree on which they are perched, although he may be
half-concealed amongst the underwood, 150 feet below them. They
stretch their necks downwards to look beneath, and on espying the
least movement amongst the foliage, fly off to the more
inaccessible parts of the forest. Solitary Toucans are sometimes
met with at the same season, hopping silently up and down the
larger boughs, and peering into crevices of the tree-trunks. They
moult in the months from March to June, some individuals earlier,
others later. This season of enforced quiet being passed, they
make their appearance suddenly in the dry forest, near Ega, in
large flocks, probably assemblages of birds gathered together from
the neighbouring Ygap&oacute; forests, which are then flooded and
cold. The birds have now become exceedingly tame, and the troops
travel with heavy laborious flight from bough to bough amongst the
lower trees. They thus become an easy prey to hunters, and
everyone at Ega who can get a gun of any sort and a few charges of
powder and shot, or a blow-pipe, goes daily to the woods to kill a
few brace for dinner; for, as already observed, the people of Ega
live almost exclusively on stewed and roasted Toucans during the
months of June and July, the birds being then very fat and the
meat exceedingly sweet and tender.</p>
<p>
No one, on seeing a Toucan, can help asking what is the use of
the enormous bill, which, in some species, attains a length of
seven inches, and a width of more than two inches. A few remarks
on this subject may be here introduced. The early naturalists,
having seen only the bill of a Toucan, which was esteemed as a
marvellous production by the <i>virtuosi</i> of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, concluded that the bird must have belonged
to the aquatic and web-footed order, as this contains so many
species of remarkable development of beak, adapted for seizing
fish. Some travellers also related fabulous stories of Toucans
resorting to the banks of rivers to feed on fish, and these
accounts also encouraged the erroneous views of the habits of the
birds which for a long time prevailed. Toucans, however, are now
well known to be eminently arboreal birds, and to belong to a
group (including trogons, parrots, and barbets<sup><a
href="#1">2</a></sup>), all of whose members are fruit-eaters. On
the Amazons, where these birds are very common, no one pretends
ever to have seen a Toucan walking on the ground in its natural
state, much less acting the part of a swimming or wading bird.
Professor Owen found, on dissection, that the gizzard in Toucans
is not so well adapted for the trituration of food as it is in
other vegetable feeders, and concluded, therefore, as Broderip had
observed the habit of chewing the cud in a tame bird, that the
great toothed bill was useful in holding and remasticating the
food. The bill can scarcely be said to be a very good contrivance
for seizing and crushing small birds, or taking them from their
nests in crevices of trees, habits which have been imputed to
Toucans by some writers. The hollow, cellular structure of the
interior of the bill, its curved and clumsy shape, and the
deficiency of force and precision when it is used to seize
objects, suggest a want of fitness, if this be the function of the
member. But fruit is undoubtedly the chief food of Toucans, and it
is in reference to their mode of obtaining it that the use of
their uncouth bills is to be sought.</p>
<p>
Flowers and fruit on the crowns of the large trees of South
American forests grow, principally, towards the end of slender
twigs, which will not bear any considerable weight; all animals,
therefore, which feed upon fruit, or on insects contained in
flowers, must, of course, have some means of reaching the ends of
the stalks from a distance. Monkeys obtain their food by
stretching forth their long arms and, in some instances, their
tails, to bring the fruit near to their mouths. Humming-birds are
endowed with highly perfected organs of flight with corresponding
muscular development by which they are enabled to sustain
themselves on the wing before blossoms whilst rifling them of
their contents. These strong-flying creatures, however, will,
whenever they can get near enough, remain on their perches whilst
probing neighbouring flowers for insects. Trogons have feeble
wings, and a dull, inactive temperament. Their mode of obtaining
food is to station themselves quietly on low branches in the
gloomy shades of the forest, and eye the fruits on the surrounding
trees, darting off, as if with an effort, every time they wish to
seize a mouthful, and returning to the same perch. Barbets
(Capitonin&aelig;) seem to have no especial endowment, either of
habits or structure, to enable them to seize fruits; and in this
respect they are similar to the Toucans, if we leave the bill out
of question, both tribes having heavy bodies, with feeble organs
of flight, so that they are disabled from taking their food on the
wing. The purpose of the enormous bill here becomes evident; it is
to enable the Toucan to reach and devour fruit whilst remaining
seated, and thus to counterbalance the disadvantage which its
heavy body and gluttonous appetite would otherwise give it in the
competition with allied groups of birds. The relation between the
extraordinarily lengthened bill of the Toucan and its mode of
obtaining food, is therefore precisely similar to that between the
long neck and lips of the Giraffe and the mode of browsing of the
animal. The bill of the Toucan can scarcely be considered a very
perfectly-formed instrument for the end to which it is applied, as
here explained; but nature appears not to invent organs at once
for the functions to which they are now adapted, but avails
herself, here of one already-existing structure or instinct, there
of another, according as they are handy when need for their
further modification arises.</p>
<p>
One day, whilst walking along the principal pathway in the
woods near Ega, I saw one of these Toucans seated gravely on a low
branch close to the road, and had no difficulty in seizing it with
my hand. It turned out to be a runaway pet bird; no one, however,
came to own it, although I kept it in my house for several months.
The bird was in a half-starved and sickly condition, but after a
few days of good living it recovered health and spirits, and
became one of the most amusing pets imaginable. Many excellent
accounts of the habits of tame Toucans have been published, and
therefore, I need not describe them in detail, but I do not
recollect to have seen any notice of their intelligence and
confiding disposition under domestication, in which qualities my
pet seemed to be almost equal to parrots. I allowed Toc&aacute;no
to go free about the house, contrary to my usual practice with pet
animals, he never, however, mounted my working-table after a smart
correction which he received the first time he did it. He used to
sleep on the top of a box in a corner of the room, in the usual
position of these birds, namely, with the long tail laid right
over on the back, and the beak thrust underneath the wing. He ate
of everything that we eat; beef, turtle, fish, farinha, fruit, and
was a constant attendant at our table&mdash;a cloth spread on a mat.
His appetite was most ravenous, and his powers of digestion quite
wonderful. He got to know the meal hours to a nicety, and we found
it very difficult, after the first week or two, to keep him away
from the dining-room, where he had become very impudent and
troublesome. We tried to shut him out by enclosing him in the
backyard, which was separated by a high fence from the street on
which our front door opened, but he used to climb the fence and
hop round by a long circuit to the dining-room, making his
appearance with the greatest punctuality as the meal was placed on
the table. He acquired the habit, afterwards, of rambling about
the street near our house, and one day he was stolen, so we gave
him up for lost. But two days afterwards he stepped through the
open doorway at dinner hour, with his old gait, and sly
magpie-like expression, having escaped from the house where he had
been guarded by the person who had stolen him, and which was
situated at the further end of the village.</p>

"Curl-crested Toucan."></center>

<p>
<i>The Curl-crested Toucan (Pteroglossus Beauharnaisii).</i>&mdash;Of
the four smaller Toucans, or Arassaris, found near Ega, the
Pteroglossus flavirostris is perhaps the most beautiful in
colours, its breast being adorned with broad belts of rich crimson
and black; but the most curious species, by far, is the
Curl-crested, or Beauharnais Toucan. The feathers on the head of
this singular bird are transformed into thin, horny plates, of a
lustrous black colour, curled up at the ends, and resembling
shavings of steel or ebony-wood: the curly crest being arranged on
the crown in the form of a wig. Mr. Wallace and I first met with
this species, on ascending the Amazons, at the mouth of the
Solimoens; from that point it continues as a rather common bird on
the terra firma, at least on the south side of the river as far as
Fonte Boa, but I did not hear of its being found further to the
west. It appears in large flocks in the forests near Ega in May
and June, when it has completed its moult. I did not find these
bands congregated at fruit-trees, but always wandering through the
forest, hopping from branch to branch amongst the lower trees, and
partly concealed amongst the foliage. None of the
Arassar&iacute;s, to my knowledge, make a yelping noise like that
uttered by the larger Toucans (Ramphastos); the notes of the
curl-crested species are very singular, resembling the croaking of
frogs. I had an amusing adventure one day with these birds. I had
shot one from a rather high tree in a dark glen in the forest, and
entered the thicket where the bird had fallen to secure my booty.
It was only wounded, and on my attempting to seize it, set up a
loud scream. In an instant, as if by magic, the shady nook seemed
alive with these birds, although there was certainly none visible
when I entered the jungle. They descended towards me, hopping from
bough to bough, some of them swinging on the loops and cables of
woody lianas, and all croaking and fluttering their wings like so
many furies. If I had had a long stick in my hand I could have
knocked several of them over. After killing the wounded one, I
began to prepare for obtaining more specimens and punishing the
viragos for their boldness; but the screaming of their companion
having ceased, they remounted the trees, and before I could
reload, every one of them had disappeared.</p>

<p>
<i>Insects.</i>&mdash;Upwards of 7000 species of insects were found
in the neighbourhood of Ega. I must confine myself in this place
to a few remarks on the order Lepidoptera, and on the ants,
several kinds of which, found chiefly on the Upper Amazons,
exhibit the most extraordinary instincts.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig35.jpg" width="307" height="474" alt=
"Suspended cocoon of Moth."></center>

<p>
I found about 550 distinct species of butterflies at Ega. Those
who know a little of Entomology will be able to form some idea of
the riches of the place in this department, when I mention that
eighteen species of true Papilio (the swallow-tail genus) were
found within ten minutes&rsquo; walk of my house. No fact could
speak more plainly for the surpassing exuberance of the
vegetation, the varied nature of the land, the perennial warmth
and humidity of the climate. But no description can convey an
adequate notion of the beauty and diversity in form and colour of
this class of insects in the neighbourhood of Ega. I paid special
attention to them, having found that this tribe was better adapted
than almost any other group of animals or plants to furnish facts
in illustration of the modifications which all species undergo in
nature, under changed local conditions. This accidental
superiority is owing partly to the simplicity and distinctness of
the specific character of the insects, and partly to the facility
with which very copious series of specimens can be collected and
placed side by side for comparison. The distinctness of the
specific characters is due probably to the fact that all the
superficial signs of change in the organisation are exaggerated,
and made unusually plain by affecting the framework, shape, and
colour of the wings, which, as many anatomists believe, are
magnified extensions of the skin around the breathing orifices of
the thorax of the insects. These expansions are clothed with
minute feathers or scales, coloured in regular patterns, which
vary in accordance with the slightest change in the conditions to
which the species are exposed. It may be said, therefore, that on
these expanded membranes Nature writes, as on a tablet, the story
of the modifications of species, so truly do all changes of the
organisation register themselves thereon. Moreover, the same
colour-patterns of the wings generally show, with great
regularity, the degrees of blood-relationship of the species. As
the laws of Nature must be the same for all beings, the
conclusions furnished by this group of insects must be applicable
to the whole organic world; therefore, the study of
butterflies&mdash;creatures selected as the types of airiness and
frivolity&mdash;instead of being despised, will some day be valued as
one of the most important branches of Biological science.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig36.jpg" width="308" height="306" alt=
"Sack-bearing Caterpillar (Saccophora)."></center>

<p>
Before proceeding to describe the ants, a few remarks may be
made on the singular cases and cocoons woven by the caterpillars
of certain moths found at Ega. The first that may be mentioned is
one of the most beautiful examples of insect workmanship I ever
saw. It is a cocoon, about the size of a sparrow&rsquo;s egg,
woven by a caterpillar in broad meshes of either buff or
rose-coloured silk, and is frequently seen in the narrow alleys of
the forest, suspended from the extreme tip of an outstanding leaf
by a strong silken thread five or six inches in length. It forms a
very conspicuous object, hanging thus in mid-air. The glossy
threads with which it is knitted are stout, and the structure is
therefore not liable to be torn by the beaks of insectivorous
birds, whilst its pendulous position makes it doubly secure
against their attacks, the apparatus giving way when they peck at
it. There is a small orifice at each end of the egg-shaped bag, to
admit of the escape of the moth when it changes from the little
chrysalis which sleeps tranquilly in its airy cage. The moth is of
a dull slatey colour, and belongs to the Lithosiide group of the
silk-worm family (Bombycid&aelig;). When the caterpillar begins
its work, it lets itself down from the tip of the leaf which it
has chosen by spinning a thread of silk, the thickness of which it
slowly increases as it descends. Having given the proper length to
the cord, it proceeds to weave its elegant bag, placing itself in
the centre and spinning rings of silk at regular intervals,
connecting them at the same time by means of cross threads; so
that the whole, when finished, forms a loose web, with
quadrangular meshes of nearly equal size throughout. The task
occupies about four days: when finished, the enclosed caterpillar
becomes sluggish, its skin shrivels and cracks, and there then
remains a motionless chrysalis of narrow shape, leaning against
the sides of its silken cage.</p>
<p>
Many other kinds are found at Ega belonging to the same
cocoon-weaving family, some of which differ from the rest in their
caterpillars possessing the art of fabricating cases with
fragments of wood or leaves, in which they live secure from all
enemies whilst they are feeding and growing. I saw many species of
these; some of them knitted together, with fine silken threads,
small bits of stick, and so made tubes similar to those of
caddice-worms; others (Saccophora) chose leaves for the same
purpose, forming with them an elongated bag open at both ends, and
having the inside lined with a thick web. The tubes of full-grown
caterpillars of Saccophora are two inches in length, and it is at
this stage of growth that I have generally seen them. They feed on
the leaves of Melastoni&aelig;, and as in crawling, the weight of
so large a dwelling would be greater than the contained
caterpillar could sustain, the insect attaches the case by one or
more threads to the leaves or twigs near which it is feeding.</p><br>
<p>
<i>Foraging Ants.</i>&mdash;Many confused statements have been
published in books of travel, and copied in Natural History works,
regarding these ants, which appear to have been confounded with
the Sa&uuml;ba, a sketch of whose habits has been given in the
first chapter of this work. The Sa&uuml;ba is a vegetable feeder,
and does not attack other animals; the accounts that have been
published regarding carnivorous ants which hunt in vast armies,
exciting terror wherever they go, apply only to the Ecitons, or
foraging ants, a totally different group of this tribe of insects.
The Ecitons are called Tau&oacute;ca by the Indians, who are
always on the look-out for their armies when they traverse the
forest, so as to avoid being attacked. I met with ten distinct
species of them, nearly all of which have a different system of
marching; eight were new to science when I sent them to England.
Some are found commonly in every part of the country, and one is
peculiar to the open campos of Santarem; but, as nearly all the
species are found together at Ega, where the forest swarmed with
their armies, I have left an account of the habits of the whole
genus for this part of my narrative. The Ecitons resemble, in
their habits, the Driver ants of Tropical Africa; but they have no
close relationship with them in structure, and indeed belong to
quite another sub-group of the ant-tribe.</p>
<p>
Like many other ants, the communities of Ecitons are composed,
besides males and females, of two classes of workers, a
large-headed (worker-major) and a small-headed (worker-minor)
class; the large-heads have, in some species, greatly lengthened
jaws, the small-heads have jaws always of the ordinary shape; but
the two classes are not sharply-defined in structure and function,
except in two of the species. There is in all of them a little
difference amongst the workers regarding the size of the head; but
in some species this is not sufficient to cause a separation into
classes, with division of labour; in others, the jaws are so
monstrously lengthened in the worker-majors, that they are
incapacitated from taking part in the labours which the
worker-minors perform; and again, in others the difference is so
great that the distinction of classes becomes complete, one acting
the part of soldiers, and the other that of workers. The peculiar
feature in the habits of the Eciton genus is their hunting for
prey in regular bodies, or armies. It is this which chiefly
distinguishes them from the genus of common red stinging-ants,
several species of which inhabit England, whose habit is to search
for food in the usual irregular manner. All the Ecitons hunt in
large organised bodies; but almost every species has its own
special manner of hunting.</p>
<p>
<i>Eciton rapax.</i>&mdash;One of the foragers, Eciton rapax, the
giant of its genus, whose worker-majors are half-an-inch in
length, hunts in single file through the forest. There is no
division into classes amongst its workers, although the difference
in size is very great, some being scarcely one-half the length of
others. The head and jaws, however, are always of the same shape,
and a gradation in size is presented from the largest to the
smallest, so that all are able to take part in the common labours
of the colony. The chief employment of the species seems to be
plundering the nests of a large and defenseless ant of another
genus (Formica), whose mangled bodies I have often seen in their
possession as they were marching away. The armies of Eciton rapax
are never very numerous.</p>
<p>
<i>Eciton legionis.</i>&mdash;Another species, E. legionis, agrees
with E. rapax in having workers not rigidly divisible into two
classes; but it is much smaller in size, not differing greatly, in
this respect, from our common English red ant (Myrmica rubra),
which it also resembles in colour. The Eciton legionis lives in
open places, and was seen only on the sandy campos of Santarem.
The movement of its hosts were, therefore, much more easy to
observe than those of all other kinds, which inhabit solely the
densest thickets; its sting and bite, also, were less formidable
than those of other species. The armies of E. legionis consist of
many thousands of individuals, and move in rather broad columns.
They are just as quick to break line, on being disturbed, and
attack hurriedly and furiously any intruding object, as the other
Ecitons. The species is not a common one, and I seldom had good
opportunities to watch its habits. The first time I saw an army
was one evening near sunset. The column consisted of two trains of
ants, moving in opposite directions; one train empty-handed, the
other laden with the mangled remains of insects, chiefly
larv&aelig; and pup&aelig; of other ants. I had no difficulty in
tracing the line to the spot from which they were conveying their
booty: this was a low thicket; the Ecitons were moving rapidly
about a heap of dead leaves; but as the short tropical twilight
was deepening rapidly, and I had no wish to be benighted on the
lonely campos, I deferred further examination until the next
day.</p>
<p>
On the following morning, no trace of ants could be found near
the place where I had seen them the preceding day, nor were there
signs of insects of any description in the thicket, but at the
distance of eighty or one hundred yards, I came upon the same
army, engaged, evidently, on a razzia of a similar kind to that of
the previous evening, but requiring other resources of their
instinct, owing to the nature of the ground. They were eagerly
occupied on the face of an inclined bank of light earth, in
excavating mines, whence, from a depth of eight or ten inches,
they were extracting the bodies of a bulky species of ant, of the
genus Formica. It was curious to see them crowding around the
orifices of the mines, some assisting their comrades to lift out
the bodies of the Formic&aelig;, and others tearing them in
pieces, on account of their weight being too great for a single
Eciton; a number of carriers seizing each a fragment, and carrying
it off down the slope. On digging into the earth with a small
trowel near the entrances of the mines, I found the nests of the
Formic&aelig;, with grubs and cocoons, which the Ecitons were thus
invading, at a depth of about eight inches from the surface. The
eager freebooters rushed in as fast as I excavated, and seized the
ants in my fingers as I picked them out, so that I had some
difficulty in rescuing a few intact for specimens. In digging the
numerous mines to get at their prey, the little Ecitons seemed to
be divided into parties, one set excavating, and another set
carrying away the grains of earth. When the shafts became rather
deep, the mining parties had to climb up the sides each time they
wished to cast out a pellet of earth; but their work was lightened
for them by comrades, who stationed themselves at the mouth of the
shaft, and relieved them of their burthens, carrying the
particles, with an appearance of foresight which quite staggered
me, a sufficient distance from the edge of the hole to prevent
them from rolling in again. All the work seemed thus to be
performed by intelligent co-operation amongst the host of eager
little creatures, but still there was not a rigid division of
labour, for some of them, whose proceedings I watched, acted at
one time as carriers of pellets, and at another as miners, and all
shortly afterwards assumed the office of conveyors of the
spoil.</p>
<p>
In about two hours, all the nests of Formic&aelig; were rifled,
though not completely, of their contents, and I turned towards the
army of Ecitons, which were carrying away the mutilated remains.
For some distance there were many separate lines of them moving
along the slope of the bank; but a short distance off, these all
converged, and then formed one close and broad column, which
continued for some sixty or seventy yards, and terminated at one
of those large termitariums or hillocks of white ants which are
constructed of cemented material as hard as stone. The broad and
compact column of ants moved up the steep sides of the hillock in
a continued stream; many, which had hitherto trotted along
empty-handed, now turned to assist their comrades with their heavy
loads, and the whole descended into a spacious gallery or mine,
opening on the top of the termitarium. I did not try to reach the
nest, which I supposed to lie at the bottom of the broad mine, and
therefore, in the middle of the base of the stony hillock.</p>
<p>
<i>Eciton drepanophora.</i>&mdash;The commonest species of foraging
ants are the Eciton hamata and E. drepanophora, two kinds which
resemble each other so closely that it requires attentive
examination to distinguish them; yet their armies never
intermingle, although moving in the same woods and often crossing
each other&rsquo;s tracks. The two classes of workers look, at
first sight, quite distinct, on account of the wonderful amount of
difference between the largest individuals of the one, and the
smallest of the other. There are dwarfs not more than one-fifth of
an inch in length, with small heads and jaws, and giants half an
inch in length with monstrously enlarged head and jaws, all
belonging to the same brood. There is not, however, a distinct
separation of classes, individuals existing which connect together
the two extremes. These Ecitons are seen in the pathways of the
forest at all places on the banks of the Amazons, travelling in
dense columns of countless thousands. One or other of them is sure
to be met with in a woodland ramble, and it is to them, probably,
that the stories we read in books on South America apply, of ants
clearing houses of vermin, although I heard of no instance of
their entering houses, their ravages being confined to the
thickest parts of the forest.</p><br>

<p>
When the pedestrian falls in with a train of these ants, the
first signal given him is a twittering and restless movement of
small flocks of plain-coloured birds (ant-thrushes) in the jungle.
If this be disregarded until he advances a few steps farther, he
is sure to fall into trouble, and find himself suddenly attacked
by numbers of the ferocious little creatures. They swarm up his
legs with incredible rapidity, each one driving his pincer-like
jaws into his skin, and with the purchase thus obtained, doubling
in its tail, and stinging with all its might. There is no course
left but to run for it; if he is accompanied by natives they will
be sure to give the alarm, crying &ldquo;Tau&oacute;ca!&rdquo; and
scampering at full speed to the other end of the column of ants.
The tenacious insects who have secured themselves to his legs then
have to be plucked off one by one, a task which is generally not
accomplished without pulling them in twain, and leaving heads and
jaws sticking in the wounds.</p>
<p>
The errand of the vast ant-armies is plunder, as in the case of
Eciton legionis; but from their moving always amongst dense
thickets, their proceedings are not so easy to observe as in that
species. Wherever they move, the whole animal world is set in
commotion, and every creature tries to get out of their way. But
it is especially the various tribes of wingless insects that have
cause for fear, such as heavy-bodied spiders, ants of other
species, maggots, caterpillars, larv&aelig; of cockroaches and so
forth, all of which live under fallen leaves, or in decaying wood.
The Ecitons do not mount very high on trees, and therefore the
nestlings of birds are not much incommoded by them. The mode of
operation of these armies, which I ascertained only after
long-continued observation, is as follows: the main column, from
four to six deep, moves forward in a given direction, clearing the
ground of all animal matter dead or alive, and throwing off here
and there a thinner column to forage for a short time on the
flanks of the main army, and re-enter it again after their task is
accomplished. If some very rich place be encountered anywhere near
the line of march, for example, a mass of rotten wood abounding in
insect larv&aelig;, a delay takes place, and a very strong force
of ants is concentrated upon it. The excited creatures search
every cranny and tear in pieces all the large grubs they drag to
light. It is curious to see them attack wasps&rsquo; nests, which
are sometimes built on low shrubs. They gnaw away the papery
covering to get at the larv&aelig;, pup&aelig;, and newly-hatched
wasps, and cut everything to tatters, regardless of the infuriated
owners which are flying about them. In bearing off their spoil in
fragments, the pieces are apportioned to the carriers with some
degree of regard to fairness of load: the dwarfs taking the
smallest pieces, and the strongest fellows with small heads the
heaviest portions. Sometimes two ants join together in carrying
one piece, but the worker-majors, with their unwieldy and
distorted jaws, are incapacitated from taking any part in the
labour. The armies never march far on a beaten path, but seem to
prefer the entangled thickets where it is seldom possible to
follow them. I have traced an army sometimes for half a mile or
more, but was never able to find one that had finished its
day&rsquo;s course and returned to its hive. Indeed, I never met
with a hive; whenever the Ecitons were seen, they were always on
the march.</p>
<p>
I thought one day, at Villa Nova, that I had come upon a
migratory horde of this indefatigable ant. The place was a tract
of open ground near the river side, just outside the edge of the
forest, and surrounded by rocks and shrubbery. A dense column of
Ecitons was seen extending from the rocks on one side of the
little haven, traversing the open space, and ascending the
opposite declivity. The length of the procession was from sixty to
seventy yards, and yet neither van nor rear was visible. All were
moving in one and the same direction, except a few individuals on
the outside of the column, which were running rearward, trotting
along for a short distance, and then turning again to follow the
same course as the main body. But these rearward movements were
going on continually from one end to the other of the line, and
there was every appearance of there being a means of keeping up a
common understanding amongst all the members of the army, for the
retrograding ants stopped very often for a moment to touch one or
other of their onward-moving comrades with their antenn&aelig;; a
proceeding which has been noticed in other ants, and supposed to
be their mode of conveying intelligence. When I interfered with
the column or abstracted an individual from it, news of the
disturbance was very quickly communicated to a distance of several
yards towards the rear, and the column at that point commenced
retreating. All the small-headed workers carried in their jaws a
little cluster of white maggots, which I thought at the time,
might be young larv&aelig; of their own colony, but afterwards
found reason to conclude were the grubs of some other species
whose nests they had been plundering, the procession being most
likely not a migration, but a column on a marauding expedition.</p>
<p>
The position of the large-headed individuals in the marching
column was rather curious. There was one of these extraordinary
fellows to about a score of the smaller class. None of them
carried anything in their mouths, but all trotted along
empty-handed and outside the column, at pretty regular intervals
from each other, like subaltern officers in a marching regiment of
soldiers. It was easy to be tolerably exact in this observation,
for their shining white heads made them very conspicuous amongst
the rest, bobbing up and down as the column passed over the
inequalities of the road. I did not see them change their
position, or take any notice of their small-headed comrades
marching in the column, and when I disturbed the line, they did
not prance forth or show fight so eagerly as the others. These
large-headed members of the community have been considered by some
authors as a soldier class, like the similarly-armed caste in
Termites; but I found no proof of this, at least in the present
species, as they always seemed to be rather less pugnacious than
the worker-minors, and their distorted jaws disabled them from
fastening on a plane surface like the skin of an attacking animal.
I am inclined, however, to think that they may act, in a less
direct way, as protectors of the community, namely, as
indigestible morsels to the flocks of ant-thrushes which follow
the marching columns of these Ecitons, and are the most formidable
enemies of the species. It is possible that the hooked and twisted
jaws of the large-headed class may be effective weapons of
annoyance when in the gizzards or stomachs of these birds, but I
unfortunately omitted to ascertain whether this was really the
fact.</p>
<p>
The life of these Ecitons is not all work, for I frequently saw
them very leisurely employed in a way that looked like recreation.
When this happened, the place was always a sunny nook in the
forest. The main column of the army and the branch columns, at
these times, were in their ordinary relative positions; but,
instead of pressing forward eagerly, and plundering right and
left, they seemed to have been all smitten with a sudden fit of
laziness. Some were walking slowly about, others were brushing
their antenn&aelig; with their forefeet; but the drollest sight
was their cleaning one another. Here and there an ant was seen
stretching forth first one leg and then another, to be brushed or
washed by one or more of its comrades, who performed the task by
passing the limb between the jaws and the tongue, and finishing by
giving the antenn&aelig; a friendly wipe. It was a curious
spectacle, and one well calculated to increase one&rsquo;s
amazement at the similarity between the instinctive actions of
ants and the acts of rational beings, a similarity which must have
been brought about by two different processes of development of
the primary qualities of mind. The actions of these ants looked
like simple indulgence in idle amusement. Have these little
creatures, then, an excess of energy beyond what is required for
labours absolutely necessary to the welfare of their species, and
do they thus expend it in mere sportiveness, like young lambs or
kittens, or in idle whims like rational beings? It is probable
that these hours of relaxation and cleaning may be indispensable
to the effective performance of their harder labours, but whilst
looking at them, the conclusion that the ants were engaged merely
in play was irresistible.</p>
<p>
<i>Eciton pr&aelig;dator.</i>&mdash;This is a small dark-reddish
species, very similar to the common red stinging-ant of England.
It differs from all other Ecitons in its habit of hunting, not in
columns, but in dense phalanxes consisting of myriads of
individuals, and was first met with at Ega, where it is very
common. Nothing in insect movements is more striking than the
rapid march of these large and compact bodies. Wherever they pass
all the rest of the animal world is thrown into a state of alarm.
They stream along the ground and climb to the summits of all the
lower trees, searching every leaf to its apex, and whenever they
encounter a mass of decaying vegetable matter, where booty is
plentiful, they concentrate, like other Ecitons, all their forces
upon it, the dense phalanx of shining and quickly-moving bodies,
as it spreads over the surface, looking like a flood of dark-red
liquid. They soon penetrate every part of the confused heap, and
then, gathering together again in marching order, onward they
move. All soft-bodied and inactive insects fall an easy prey to
them, and, like other Ecitons, they tear their victims in pieces
for facility of carriage. A phalanx of this species, when passing
over a tract of smooth ground, occupies a space of from four to
six square yards; on examining the ants closely they are seen to
move, not altogether in one straightforward direction, but in
variously spreading contiguous columns, now separating a little
from the general mass, now re-uniting with it. The margins of the
phalanx spread out at times like a cloud of skirmishers from the
flanks of an army. I was never able to find the hive of this
species.</p>
<p>
<i>Blind Ecitons.</i>&mdash;I will now give a short account of the
blind species of Eciton. None of the foregoing kinds have eyes of
the facetted or compound structure such as are usual in insects,
and which ordinary ants (Formica) are furnished with, but all are
provided with organs of vision composed each of a single lens.
Connecting them with the utterly blind species of the genus, is a
very stout-limbed Eciton, the E. crassicornis, whose eyes are sunk
in rather deep sockets. This ant goes on foraging expeditions like
the rest of its tribe, and attacks even the nests of other
stinging species (Myrmica), but it avoids the light, moving always
in concealment under leaves and fallen branches. When its columns
have to cross a cleared space, the ants construct a temporary
covered way with granules of earth, arched over, and holding
together mechanically; under this, the procession passes in
secret, the indefatigable creatures repairing their arcade as fast
as breaches are made in it.</p><br>

"Foraging ants (Eciton erratica) constructing a covered
road&mdash;Soldiers sallying out on being disturbed."> </center>

<p>
Next in order comes the Eciton vastator, which has no eyes,
although the collapsed sockets are plainly visible; and, lastly,
the Eciton erratica, in which both sockets and eyes have
disappeared, leaving only a faint ring to mark the place where
they are usually situated. The armies of E. vastator and E.
erratica move, as far as I could learn, wholly under covered
roads, the ants constructing them gradually but rapidly as they
advance. The column of foragers pushes forward step by step under
the protection of these covered passages, through the thickets,
and upon reaching a rotting log, or other promising
hunting-ground, pour into the crevices in search of booty. I have
traced their arcades, occasionally, for a distance of one or two
hundred yards; the grains of earth are taken from the soil over
which the column is passing, and are fitted together without
cement. It is this last-mentioned feature that distinguishes them
from the similar covered roads made by Termites, who use their
glutinous saliva to cement the grains together. The blind Ecitons,
working in numbers, build up simultaneously the sides of their
convex arcades, and contrive, in a surprising manner, to
approximate them and fit in the key-stones without letting the
loose uncemented structure fall to pieces. There was a very clear
division of labour between the two classes of neuters in these
blind species. The large-headed class, although not possessing
monstrously-lengthened jaws like the worker-majors in E. hamata
and E. drepanophora, are rigidly defined in structure from the
small-headed class, and act as soldiers, defending the working
community (like soldier Termites) against all comers. Whenever I
made a breach in one of their covered ways, all the ants
underneath were set in commotion, but the worker-minors remained
behind to repair the damage, whilst the large-heads issued forth
in a most menacing manner, rearing their heads and snapping their
jaws with an expression of the fiercest rage and defiance.</p>
