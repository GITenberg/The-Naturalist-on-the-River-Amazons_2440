<br>
<p class="first">That part of the Par&aacute; river which lies in
front of the city, as I have already explained, forms a narrow
channel, being separated from the main waters of the estuary by a
cluster of islands. This channel is about two miles broad, and
constitutes part of the minor estuary of Goajar&aacute;, into which
the three rivers Guam&aacute;, Moj&uacute;, and Acar&aacute;
discharge their waters. The main channel of the Par&aacute; lies
ten miles away from the city, directly across the river; at that
point, after getting clear of the islands, a great expanse of water
is beheld, ten to twelve miles in width; on the opposite shore the
island of Maraj&oacute;, being visible only in clear weather as a
line of tree-tops dotting the horizon. A little further upwards,
that is to the southwest, the mainland on the right or eastern
shore appears, this is called Carnapij&oacute;; it is rocky,
covered with the never-ending forest, and the coast, which is
fringed with broad sandy beaches, describes a gentle curve inwards.
The broad reach of the Par&aacute; in front of this coast is called
the Bahia, or Bay of Maraj&oacute;. The coast and the interior of
the land are peopled by civilised Indians and Mamelucos, with a
mixture of free negroes and mulattos. They are poor, for the waters
are not abundant in fish, and they are dependent for a livelihood
solely on their small plantations, and the scant supply of game
found in the woods. The district was originally peopled by various
tribes of Indians, of whom the principal were the Tupinamb&aacute;s
and Nhengah&iacute;bas. Like all the coast tribes, whether
inhabiting the banks of the Amazons or the seashore between
Par&aacute; and Bahia, they were far more advanced in civilisation
than the hordes scattered through the interior of the country, some
of which still remain in the wild state, between the Amazons and
the Plata. There are three villages on the coast of
Carnapij&oacute;, and several planters&rsquo; houses, formerly the
centres of flourishing estates, which have now relapsed into forest
in consequence of the scarcity of labour and diminished enterprise.
One of the largest of these establishments is called Carip&iacute;.
At the time of which I am speaking, it belonged to a Scotch
gentleman, Mr. Campbell, who had married the daughter of a large
Brazilian proprietor. Most of the occasional English and American
visitors to Par&aacute; had made some stay at Carip&iacute;, and it
had obtained quite a reputation for the number and beauty of the
birds and insects found there; I therefore applied for, and
obtained permission, to spend two or three months at the place. The
distance from Par&aacute; was about twenty-three miles, round by
the northern end of the Ilha das oncas (Isle of Tigers), which
faces the city. I bargained for a passage thither with the cabo of
a small trading-vessel, which was going past the place, and started
on the 7th of December, 1848.</p>

<p>We were thirteen persons aboard: the cabo, his pretty mulatto
mistress, the pilot and five Indian canoemen, three young mamelucos
(tailor-apprentices who were taking a holiday trip to
Camet&aacute;), a heavily chained runaway slave, and myself. The
young mamelucos were pleasant, gentle fellows; they could read and
write, and amused themselves on the voyage with a book containing
descriptions and statistics of foreign countries, in which they
seemed to take great interest&mdash;one reading whilst the others
listened. At Uirapiranga, a small island behind the Ilha das oncas,
we had to stop a short time to embark several pipes of
casha&ccedil;a at a sugar estate. The cabo took the montaria and
two men; the pipes were rolled into the water and floated to the
canoe, the men passing cables round and towing them through a rough
sea. Here we slept, and the following morning, continuing our
voyage, entered a narrow channel which intersects the land of
Carnapij&oacute;. At 2 p.m. we emerged from this channel, which is
called the Aitit&uacute;ba, or Arrozal, into the broad Bahia, and
then saw, two or three miles away to the left, the red-tiled
mansion of Carip&iacute;, embosomed in woods on the shores of a
charming little bay.</p>

<p>The water is very shallow near the shore, and when the wind
blows there is a heavy ground swell. A few years previously, an
English gentleman, Mr. Graham, an amateur naturalist, was capsized
here and drowned with his wife and child, whilst passing in a
heavily-laden montaria to his large canoe. Remembering their fate,
I was rather alarmed to see that I should be obliged to take all my
luggage ashore in one trip in a leaky little boat. The pile of
chests with two Indians and myself sank the montaria almost to the
level of the water. I was kept busy bailing all the way. The
Indians manage canoes in this condition with admirable skill. They
preserve the nicest equilibrium, and paddle so gently that not the
slightest oscillation is perceptible. On landing, an old negress
named Florinda, the feitora or manageress of the establishment
(which was kept only as a poultry-farm and hospital for sick
slaves), gave me the keys, and I forthwith took possession of the
rooms I required.</p>

<p>I remained here nine weeks, or until the 12th of February, 1849.
The house was very large and most substantially built, but
consisted of only one story. I was told it was built by the Jesuits
more than a century ago. The front had no veranda, the doors
opening upon a slightly elevated terrace about a hundred yards
distant from the broad sandy beach. Around the residence the ground
had been cleared to the extent of two or three acres, and was
planted with fruit trees. Well-trodden pathways through the forest
led to little colonies of the natives on the banks of retired
creeks and rivulets in the interior. I led here a solitary but not
unpleasant life; for there was a great charm in the loneliness of
the place. The swell of the river beating on the sloping beach
caused an unceasing murmur, which lulled me to sleep at night, and
seemed appropriate music in those midday hours when all nature was
pausing breathless under the rays of a vertical sun. Here I spent
my first Christmas Day in a foreign land. The festival was
celebrated by the negroes of their own free will and in a very
pleasing manner. The room next to the one I had chosen was the
capella, or chapel. It had a little altar which was neatly
arranged, and the room was furnished with a magnificent brass
chandelier. Men, women, and children were busy in the chapel all
day on the 24th of December decorating the altar with flowers and
strewing the floor with orange-leaves. They invited some of their
neighbours to the evening prayers, and when the simple ceremony
began an hour before midnight, the chapel was crowded. They were
obliged to dispense with the mass, for they had no priest; the
service therefore consisted merely of a long litany and a few
hymns. There was placed on the altar a small image of the infant
Christ, the &ldquo;Menino Deos&rdquo; as they called it, or the
child-god, which had a long ribbon depending from its waist. An old
white-haired negro led off the litany, and the rest of the people
joined in the responses. After the service was over they all went
up to the altar, one by one, and kissed the end of the ribbon. The
gravity and earnestness shown throughout the proceedings were
remarkable. Some of the hymns were very simple and beautiful,
especially one beginning &ldquo;Virgem soberana,&rdquo; a trace of
whose melody springs to my recollection whenever I think on the
dreamy solitude of Carip&iacute;.</p>

<p>The next day after I arrived, two blue-eyed and red-haired boys
came up and spoke to me in English, and presently their father made
his appearance. They proved to be a German family named Petzell,
who were living in the woods, Indian fashion, about a mile from
Carip&iacute;. Petzell explained to me how he came here. He said
that thirteen years ago he came to Brazil with a number of other
Germans under engagement to serve in the Brazilian army. When his
time had expired he came to Par&aacute; to see the country, but
after a few months&rsquo; rambling left the place to establish
himself in the United States. There he married, went to Illinois,
and settled as farmer near St. Louis. He remained on his farm seven
or eight years, and had a family of five children. He could never
forget, however, the free river-life and perpetual summer of the
banks of the Amazons; so, he persuaded his wife to consent to break
up their home in North America, and migrate to Par&aacute;. No one
can imagine the difficulties the poor fellow had to go through
before reaching the land of his choice. He first descended the
Mississippi, feeling sure that a passage to Par&aacute; could be
got at New Orleans. He was there told that the only port in North
America he could start from was New York, so away he sailed for New
York; but there was no chance of a vessel sailing thence to
Par&aacute;, so he took a passage to Demerara, as bringing him, at
any rate, near to the desired land. There is no communication
whatever between Demerara and Par&aacute;, and he was forced to
remain here with his family four or five months, during which they
all caught the yellow fever, and one of his children died. At
length, he heard of a small coasting vessel going to Cayenne, so he
embarked, and thereby got another stage nearer the end of his
journey. A short time after reaching Cayenne, he shipped in a
schooner that was going to Par&aacute;, or rather the island of
Maraj&oacute;, for a cargo of cattle. He had now fixed himself,
after all his wanderings, in a healthy and fertile little nook on
the banks of a rivulet near Carip&iacute;, built himself a log-hut,
and planted a large patch of mandioca and Indian corn. He seemed to
be quite happy, but his wife complained much of the want of
wholesome food, meat, and wheaten bread. I asked the children
whether they liked the country; they shook their heads, and said
they would rather be in Illinois. Petzell told me that his Indian
neighbours treated him very kindly; one or other of them called
almost every day to see how he was getting on, and they had helped
him in many ways. He had a high opinion of the Tapuyos, and said,
&ldquo;If you treat them well, they will go through fire to serve
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Petzell and his family were expert insect-collectors, so I
employed them at this work during my stay at Carip&iacute;. The
daily occurrences here were after a uniform fashion. I rose with
the dawn, took a cup of coffee, and then sallied forth after birds.
At ten I breakfasted, and devoted the hours from ten until three to
entomology. The evening was occupied in preserving and storing my
captures. Petzell and I sometimes undertook long excursions,
occupying the whole day. Our neighbours used to bring me all the
quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, and shells they met with, and so
altogether I was enabled to acquire a good collection of the
productions of the district.</p>

<p>The first few nights I was much troubled by bats. The room where
I slept had not been used for many months, and the roof was open to
the tiles and rafters. The first night I slept soundly and did not
perceive anything unusual, but on the next I was aroused about
midnight by the rushing noise made by vast hosts of bats sweeping
about the room. The air was alive with them; they had put out the
lamp, and when I relighted it the place appeared blackened with the
impish multitudes that were whirling round and round. After I had
laid about well with a stick for a few minutes, they disappeared
amongst the tiles, but when all was still again they returned, and
once more extinguished the light. I took no further notice of them,
and went to sleep. The next night several got into my hammock; I
seized them as they were crawling over me, and dashed them against
the wall. The next morning I found a wound, evidently caused by a
bat, on my hip. This was rather unpleasant, so I set to work with
the negroes, and tried to exterminate them. I shot a great many as
they hung from the rafters, and the negroes having mounted with
ladders to the roof outside, routed out from beneath the caves many
hundreds of them, including young broods. There were altogether
four species&mdash;two belonging to the genus Dysopes, one to
Phyllostoma, and the fourth to Glossophaga. By far the greater
number belonged to the Dysopes perotis, a species having very large
ears, and measuring two feet from tip to tip of the wings. The
Phyllostoma was a small kind, of a dark-grey colour, streaked with
white down the back, and having a leaf-shaped fleshy expansion on
the tip of the nose. I was never attacked by bats except on this
occasion. The fact of their sucking the blood of persons sleeping,
from wounds which they make in the toes, is now well established;
but it is only a few persons who are subject to this blood-letting.
According to the negroes, the Phyllostoma is the only kind which
attacks man. Those which I caught crawling over me were Dysopes,
and I am inclined to think many different kinds of bats have this
propensity.</p>

<p>One day I was occupied searching for insects in the bark of a
fallen tree, when I saw a large cat-like animal advancing towards
the spot. It came within a dozen yards before perceiving me. I had
no weapon with me but an old chisel, and was getting ready to
defend myself if it should make a spring, when it turned around
hastily and trotted off. I did not obtain a very distinct view of
it, but I could see its colour was that of the Puma, or American
Lion, although it was rather too small for that species. The Puma
is not a common animal in the Amazons forests. I did not see
altogether more than a dozen skins, in the possession of the
natives. The fur is of a fawn colour. On account of its hue
resembling that of a deer common in the forests, the natives call
it the Sass&uacute;-ar&aacute;na,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> or
the false deer; that is, an animal which deceives one at first
sight by its superficial resemblance to a deer. The hunters are not
at all afraid of it, and speak always in disparaging terms of its
courage. Of the Jaguar, they give a very different account.</p>

<p>The only species of monkey I met with at Carip&iacute; was the
same dark-coloured little Midas already mentioned as found near
Par&aacute;. The great Ant-eater, Tamandua of the natives
(Myrmecophaga jubata), was not uncommon here. After the first few
weeks of residence, I ran short of fresh provisions. The people of
the neighbourhood had sold me all the fowls they could spare; I had
not yet learned to eat the stale and stringy salt-fish which is the
staple food in these places, and for several days I had lived on
rice-porridge, roasted bananas, and farinha. Florinda asked me
whether I could eat Tamandu&aacute;. I told her almost anything in
the shape of flesh would be acceptable; so the same day she went
with an old negro named Antonio and the dogs, and in the evening
brought one of the animals. The meat was stewed and turned out very
good, something like goose in flavour. The people at Carip&iacute;
would not touch a morsel, saying it was not considered fit to eat
in these parts; I had read, however, that it was an article of food
in other countries of South America. During the next two or three
weeks, whenever we were short of fresh meat, Antonio was always
ready, for a small reward, to get me a Tamandu&aacute;. But one day
he came to me in great distress, with the news that his favourite
dog, Atrevido, had been caught in the grip of an ant-eater, and was
killed. We hastened to the place, and found the dog was not dead,
but severely torn by the claws of the animal, which itself was
mortally wounded, and was now relaxing its grasp.</p>

<p>The habits of the Myrmecophaga jubata are now pretty well known.
It is not uncommon in the drier forests of the Amazons valley, but
is not found, I believe, in the Ygap&oacute;, or flooded lands. The
Brazilians call the species the Tamandu&aacute; bandeira, or the
Banner Ant-eater, the term banner being applied in allusion to the
curious colouration of the animal, each side of the body having a
broad oblique stripe, half grey and half black, which gives it some
resemblance to a heraldic banner. It has an excessively long
slender muzzle, and a wormlike extensile tongue. Its jaws are
destitute of teeth. The claws are much elongated, and its gait is
very awkward. It lives on the ground, and feeds on termites, or
white ants; the long claws being employed to pull in pieces the
solid hillocks made by the insects, and the long flexible tongue to
lick them up from the crevices. All the other species of this
singular genus are arboreal. I met with four species altogether.
One was the Myrmecophaga tetradactyla; the two others, more curious
and less known, were very small kinds, called Tamandu&aacute;-i.
Both are similar in size&mdash;ten inches in length, exclusive of
the tail&mdash;and in the number of the claws, having two of
unequal length to the anterior feet, and four to the hind feet. One
species is clothed with greyish-yellow silky hair; this is of rare
occurrence. The other has a fur of a dingy brown colour, without
silky lustre. One was brought to me alive at Carip&iacute;, having
been caught by an Indian, clinging motionless inside a hollow tree.
I kept it in the house about twenty-four hours. It had a moderately
long snout, curved downwards, and extremely small eyes. It remained
nearly all the time without motion except when irritated, in which
case it reared itself on its hind legs from the back of a chair to
which it clung, and clawed out with its forepaws like a cat. Its
manner of clinging with its claws, and the sluggishness of its
motions, gave it a great resemblance to a sloth. It uttered no
sound, and remained all night on the spot where I had placed it in
the morning. The next day, I put it on a tree in the open air, and
at night it escaped. These small Tamandu&aacute;s are nocturnal in
their habits, and feed on those species of termites which construct
earthy nests that look like ugly excrescences on the trunks and
branches of trees. The different kinds of ant-eaters are thus
adapted to various modes of life, terrestrial and arboreal. Those
which live on trees are again either diurnal or nocturnal, for
Myrmecophaga tetradactyla is seen moving along the main branches in
the daytime. The allied group of the Sloths, which are still more
exclusively South American forms than ant-eaters are, at the
present time furnish arboreal species only, but formerly
terrestrial forms of sloths also existed, as the Megatherium, whose
mode of life was a puzzle, seeing that it was of too colossal a
size to live on trees, until Owen showed how it might have obtained
its food from the ground.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig10.jpg" width="297" height="221" alt=
"Humming-bird and Humming-bird Hawk-moth."></center>

<p>In January the orange-trees became covered with blossom&mdash;at
least to a greater extent than usual, for they flower more or less
in this country all the year round&mdash;and attracting a great
number of humming-birds. Every day, in the cooler hours of the
morning, and in the evening from four o&rsquo;clock until six, they
were to be seen whirring about the trees by scores. Their motions
are unlike those of all other birds. They dart to and fro so
swiftly that the eye can scarcely follow them, and when they stop
before a flower, it is only for a few moments. They poise
themselves in an unsteady manner, their wings moving with
inconceivable rapidity, probe the flower, and then shoot off to
another part of the tree. They do not proceed in that methodical
manner which bees follow, taking the flowers seriatim, but skip
about from one part of the tree to another in the most capricious
way. Sometimes two males close with each other and fight, mounting
upwards in the struggle, as insects are often seen to do when
similarly engaged, and then separating hastily and darting back to
their work. Now and then they stop to rest, perching on leafless
twigs, where they may be sometimes seen probing, from the places
where they sit, the flowers within their reach. The brilliant
colours with which they are adorned cannot be seen whilst they are
fluttering about, nor can the different species be distinguished
unless they have a deal of white hue in their plumage, such as
Heliothrix auritus, which is wholly white underneath, although of a
glittering green colour above, and the white-tailed Florisuga
mellivora. There is not a great variety of humming-birds in the
Amazons region, the number of species being far smaller in these
uniform forest plains than in the diversified valleys of the Andes,
under the same parallels of latitude. The family is divisible into
two groups, contrasted in form and habits: one containing species
which live entirely in the shade of the forest, and the other
comprising those which prefer open sunny places. The forest species
(Phaethornin&aelig;) are seldom seen at flowers, flowers being, in
the shady places where they abide, of rare occurrence; but they
search for insects on leaves, threading the bushes and passing
above and beneath each leaf with wonderful rapidity. The other
group (Trochilin&aelig;) are not quite confined to cleared places,
as they come into the forest wherever a tree is in blossom, and
descend into sunny openings where flowers are to be found. But it
is only where the woods are less dense than usual that this is the
case; in the lofty forests and twilight shades of the lowlands and
islands, they are scarcely ever seen. I searched well at
Carip&iacute;, expecting to find the Lophornis Gouldii, which I was
told had been obtained in the locality. This is one of the most
beautiful of all humming-birds, having round the neck a frill of
long white feathers tipped with golden green. I was not, however,
so fortunate as to meet with it. Several times I shot by mistake a
humming-bird hawk-moth instead of a bird. This moth (Macroglossa
Titan) is somewhat smaller than humming-birds generally are; but
its manner of flight, and the way it poises itself before a flower
whilst probing it with its proboscis, are precisely like the same
actions of humming-birds. It was only after many days&rsquo;
experience that I learned to distinguish one from the other when on
the wing. This resemblance has attracted the notice of the natives,
all of whom, even educated whites, firmly believe that one is
transmutable into the other. They have observed the metamorphosis
of caterpillars into butterflies, and think it not at all more
wonderful that a moth should change into a humming-bird. The
resemblance between this hawk-moth and a humming-bird is certainly
very curious, and strikes one even when both are examined in the
hand. Holding them sideways, the shape of the head and position of
the eyes in the moth are seen to be nearly the same as in the bird,
the extended proboscis representing the long beak. At the tip of
the moth&rsquo;s body there is a brush of long hair-scales
resembling feathers, which, being expanded, looks very much like a
bird&rsquo;s tail. But, of course, all these points of resemblance
are merely superficial. The negroes and Indians tried to convince
me that the two were of the same species. &ldquo;Look at their
feathers,&rdquo; they said; &ldquo;their eyes are the same, and so
are their tails.&rdquo; This belief is so deeply rooted that it was
useless to reason with them on the subject. The Macroglossa moths
are found in most countries, and have everywhere the same habits;
one well-known species is found in England. Mr. Gould relates that
he once had a stormy altercation with an English gentleman, who
affirmed that humming-birds were found in England, for he had seen
one flying in Devonshire, meaning thereby the moth Macroglossa
stellatarum. The analogy between the two creatures has been brought
about, probably, by the similarity of their habits, there being no
indication of the one having been adapted in outward appearance
with reference to the other.</p>

<p>It has been observed that humming-birds are unlike other birds
in their mental qualities, resembling in this respect insects
rather than warm-blooded vertebrate animals. The want of expression
in their eyes, the small degree of versatility in their actions,
the quickness and precision of their movements, are all so many
points of resemblance between them and insects. In walking along
the alleys of the forest, a Phaethornis frequently crosses
one&rsquo;s path, often stopping suddenly and remaining poised in
mid-air, a few feet distant from the face of the intruder. The
Phaethornin&aelig; are certainly more numerous in the Amazons
region than the Trochilin&aelig;. They build their nests, which are
made of fine vegetable fibres and lichens; densely woven together
and thickly lined with silk-cotton from the fruit of the
sama&uuml;ma tree (Eriodendron samauma); and on the inner sides
lined with of the tips of palm-fronds. They are long and
purse-shaped. The young when first hatched have very much shorter
bills than their parents. The only species of Trochilin&aelig;
which I found at Carip&iacute; were the little brassy-green
Polytmus viridissimus, the sapphire and emerald (Thalurania
furcata), and the large falcate-winged Campylopterus obscurus.</p>

<p>Snakes were very numerous at Carip&iacute;; many harmless
species were found near the house, and these sometimes came into
the rooms. I was wandering one day amongst the green bushes of
Guajar&aacute;, a tree which yields a grape-like berry
(Chrysobalanus Icaco) and grows along all these sandy shores, when
I was startled by what appeared to be the flexuous stem of a
creeping plant endowed with life and threading its way amongst the
leaves and branches. This animated liana turned out to be a
pale-green snake, the Dryophis fulgida. Its whole body is of the
same green hue, and it is thus rendered undistinguishable amidst
the foliage of the Guajar&aacute; bushes, where it prowls in search
of its prey, tree-frogs and lizards. The forepart of its head is
prolonged into a slender pointed beak, and the total length of the
reptile was six feet. There was another kind found amongst bushes
on the borders of the forest closely allied to this, but much more
slender, viz., the Dryophis acuminata. This grows to a length of
four feet eight inches, the tail alone being twenty-two inches; but
the diameter of the thickest part of the body is little more than a
quarter of an inch. It is of light-brown colour, with iridescent
shades variegated with obscurer markings, and looks like a piece of
whipcord. One individual which I caught of this species had a
protuberance near the middle of the body. Upon opening it, I found
a half-digested lizard which was much more bulky than the snake
itself. Another kind of serpent found here, a species of Helicops,
was amphibious in its habits. I saw several of this in wet weather
on the beach, which, on being approached, always made straightway
for the water, where they swam with much grace and dexterity.
Florinda one day caught a Helicops whilst angling for fish, it
having swallowed the fishhook with the bait. She and others told me
these water-snakes lived on small fishes, but I did not meet with
any proof of the statement. In the woods, snakes were constantly
occurring; it was not often, however, that I saw poisonous species.
There were many arboreal kinds besides the two just mentioned; and
it was rather alarming, in entomologising about the trunks of
trees, to suddenly encounter, on turning round, as sometimes
happened, a pair of glittering eyes and a forked tongue within a
few inches of one&rsquo;s head. The last kind I shall mention is
the Coral-snake, which is a most beautiful object when seen coiled
up on black soil in the woods. The one I saw here was banded with
black and vermilion, the black bands having each two clear white
rings. The state of specimens preserved in spirits can give no idea
of the brilliant colours which adorn the Coral-snake in life.</p>

<br>
<p>Petzell and I, as already mentioned, made many excursions of
long extent in the neighbouring forest. We sometimes went to
Murucup&iacute;, a creek which passes through the forest, about
four miles behind Carip&iacute;, the banks of which are inhabited
by Indians and half-breeds who have lived there for many
generations in perfect seclusion from the rest of the world, the
place being little known or frequented. A path from Carip&iacute;
leads to it through a gloomy tract of virgin forest, where the
trees are so closely packed together that the ground beneath is
thrown into the deepest shade, under which nothing but fetid fungi
and rotting vegetable debris is to be seen. On emerging from this
unfriendly solitude near the banks of the Murucup&iacute;, a
charming contrast is presented. A glorious vegetation, piled up to
an immense height, clothes the banks of the creek, which traverses
a broad tract of semi-cultivated ground, and the varied masses of
greenery are lighted up with the sunny glow. Open palm-thatched
huts peep forth here and there from amidst groves of banana, mango,
cotton, and papaw trees and palms. On our first excursion, we
struck the banks of the river in front of a house of somewhat more
substantial architecture than the rest, having finished mud walls
that were plastered and whitewashed, and had a covering of red
tiles. It seemed to be full of children, and the aspect of the
household was improved by a number of good-looking mameluco women,
who were busily employed washing, spinning, and making farinha. Two
of them, seated on a mat in the open verandah, were engaged sewing
dresses, for a festival was going to take place a few days hence at
Balcarem, a village eight miles distant from Murucup&iacute;, and
they intended to be present to hear mass and show their finery. One
of the children, a naked boy about seven years of age, crossed over
with the montaria to fetch us. We were made welcome at once, and
asked to stay for dinner. On our accepting the invitation, a couple
of fowls were killed, and a wholesome stew of seasoned rice and
fowls soon put into preparation. It is not often that the female
members of a family in these retired places are familiar with
strangers; but, these people had lived a long time in the capital,
and therefore, were more civilised than their neighbours. Their
father had been a prosperous tradesman, and had given them the best
education the place afforded. After his death the widow with
several daughters, married and unmarried, retired to this secluded
spot, which had been their sitio, farm or country-house, for many
years. One of the daughters was married to a handsome young
mulatto, who was present, and sang us some pretty songs,
accompanying himself on the guitar.</p>

<p>After dinner I expressed a wish to see more of the creek; so a
lively and polite old man, whom I took to be one of the neighbours,
volunteered as guide. We embarked in a little montaria, and paddled
some three or four miles up and down the stream. Although I had now
become familiarised with beautiful vegetation, all the glow of
fresh admiration came again to me in this place. The creek was
about a hundred yards wide, but narrower in some places. Both banks
were masked by lofty walls of green drapery, here and there a break
occurring, through which, under overarching trees, glimpses were
obtained of the palm-thatched huts of settlers. The projecting
boughs of lofty trees, which in some places stretched half-way
across the creek, were hung with natural garlands and festoons, and
an endless variety of creeping plants clothed the water-frontage,
some of which, especially the Bignonias, were ornamented with large
gaily-coloured flowers. Art could not have assorted together
beautiful vegetable forms so harmoniously as was here done by
Nature. Palms, as usual, formed a large proportion of the lower
trees; some of them, however, shot up their slim stems to a height
of sixty feet or more, and waved their bunches of nodding plumes
between us and the sky. One kind of palm, the Pashi&uacute;ba
(Iriartea exorhiza), which grows here in greater abundance than
elsewhere, was especially attractive. It is not one of the tallest
kinds, for when full-grown its height is not more, perhaps, than
forty feet; the leaves are somewhat less drooping, and the leaflets
much broader than in other species, so that they have not that
feathery appearance which those of some palms have, but still they
possess their own peculiar beauty. My guide put me ashore in one
place to show me the roots of the Pashi&uacute;ba. These grow above
ground, radiating from the trunk many feet above the surface, so
that the tree looks as if supported on stilts; and a person can, in
old trees, stand upright amongst the roots with the perpendicular
stem wholly above his head. It adds to the singularity of their
appearance that these roots, which have the form of straight rods,
are studded with stout thorns, whilst the trunk of the tree is
quite smooth. The purpose of this curious arrangement is, perhaps,
similar to that of the buttress roots already
described&mdash;namely, to recompense the tree by root-growth above
the soil for its inability, in consequence of the competition of
neighbouring roots, to extend it underground. The great amount of
moisture and nutriment contained in the atmosphere may also favour
these growths.</p>

<p>On returning to the house, I found Petzell had been well
occupied during the hot hours of the day collecting insects in a
neighbouring clearing. Our kind hosts gave us a cup of coffee about
five o&rsquo;clock, and we then started for home. The last mile of
our walk was performed in the dark. The forest in this part is
obscure even in broad daylight, but I was scarcely prepared for the
intense opacity of darkness which reigned here on this night, and
which prevented us from seeing each other whilst walking side by
side. Nothing occurred of a nature to alarm us, except that now and
then a sudden rush was heard amongst the trees, and once a dismal
shriek startled us. Petzell tripped at one place and fell all his
length into the thicket. With this exception, we kept well to the
pathway, and in due time arrived safely at Carip&iacute;.</p>

<br>
<p>One of my neighbours at Murucup&iacute; was a hunter of
reputation in these parts. He was a civilised Indian, married and
settled, named Raimundo, whose habit was to sally forth at
intervals to certain productive hunting-grounds, the situation of
which he kept secret, and procure fresh provisions for his family.
I had found out by this time that animal food was as much a
necessary of life in this exhausting climate as it is in the North
of Europe. An attempt which I made to live on vegetable food was
quite a failure, and I could not eat the execrable salt-fish which
Brazilians use. I had been many days without meat of any kind, and
nothing more was to be found near Carip&iacute;, so I asked as a
favour of Senhor Raimundo permission to accompany him on one of his
hunting-trips, and shoot a little game for my own use. He
consented, and appointed a day on which I was to come over to his
house to sleep, so as to be ready for starting with the ebb-tide
shortly after midnight.</p>

<p>The locality we were to visit was situated near the extreme
point of the land of Carnapij&oacute;, where it projects
northwardly into the middle of the Par&aacute; estuary, and is
broken into a number of islands. On the afternoon of January 11th,
1849, I walked through the woods to Raimundo&rsquo;s house, taking
nothing with me but a double-barrelled gun, a supply of ammunition,
and a box for the reception of any insects I might capture.
Raimundo was a carpenter, and seemed to be a very industrious, man;
he had two apprentices, Indians like himself&mdash;one a young lad,
and the other apparently about twenty years of age. His wife was of
the same race. The Indian women are not always of a taciturn
disposition like their husbands. Senhora Dominga was very
talkative; there was another old squaw at the house on a visit, and
the tongues of the two were going at a great rate the whole
evening, using only the Tup&iacute; language. Raimundo and his
apprentices were employed building a canoe. Notwithstanding his
industry, he seemed to be very poor, and this was the condition of
most of the residents on the banks of the Murucup&iacute;. They
have, nevertheless, considerable plantations of mandioca and Indian
corn, besides small plots of cotton, coffee, and sugarcane; the
soil is very fertile, they have no rent to pay, and no direct
taxes. There is, moreover, always a market in Par&aacute;, twenty
miles distant, for their surplus produce, and a ready communication
with it by water.</p>

<p>In the evening we had more visitors. The sounds of pipe and
tabor were heard, and presently a procession of villagers emerged
from a pathway through the mandioca fields. They were on a begging
expedition for St. Thom&eacute;, the patron saint of Indians and
Mamelucos. One carried a banner, on which was crudely painted the
figure of St. Thom&eacute; with a glory round his head. The pipe
and tabor were of the simplest description. The pipe was a reed
pierced with four holes, by means of which a few unmusical notes
were produced, and the tabor was a broad hoop with a skin stretched
over each end. A deformed young man played both the instruments.
Senhor Raimundo received them with the quiet politeness which comes
so naturally to the Indian when occupying the position of host. The
visitors, who had come from the Villa de Cond&eacute;, five miles
through the forest, were invited to rest. Raimundo then took the
image of St. Thom&eacute; from one of the party, and placed it by
the side of Nossa Senhora in his own oratorio, a little decorated
box in which every family keeps its household gods, finally
lighting a couple of wax candles before it. Shortly afterwards a
cloth was laid on a mat, and all the guests were invited to supper.
The fare was very scanty; a boiled fowl with rice, a slice of
roasted piraruc&uacute;, farinha, and bananas. Each one partook
very sparingly, some of the young men contenting themselves with a
plateful of rice. One of the apprentices stood behind with a bowl
of water and a towel, with which each guest washed his fingers and
rinsed his mouth after the meal. They stayed all night: the large
open shed was filled with hammocks, which were slung from pole to
pole; and upon retiring, Raimundo gave orders for their breakfast
in the morning.</p>

<p>Raimundo called me at two o&rsquo;clock, when we embarked (he,
his older apprentice Joaquim, and myself) in a shady place where it
was so dark that I could see neither canoe nor water, taking with
us five dogs. We glided down a winding creek where huge trunks of
trees slanted across close overhead, and presently emerged into the
Murucup&iacute;. A few yards further on we entered the broader
channel of the Aitit&uacute;ba. This we crossed, and entered
another narrow creek on the opposite side. Here the ebb-tide was
against us, and we had great difficulty in making progress. After
we had struggled against the powerful current a distance of two
miles, we came to a part where the ebb-tide ran in the opposite
direction, showing that we had crossed the watershed. The tide
flows into this channel or creek at both ends simultaneously, and
meets in the middle, although there is apparently no difference of
level, and the breadth of the water is the same. The tides are
extremely intricate throughout all the infinite channels and creeks
which intersect the lands of the Amazons delta. The moon now broke
forth and lighted up the trunks of colossal trees, the leaves of
monstrous Jupat&iacute; palms which arched over the creek, and
revealed groups of arborescent arums standing like rows of spectres
on its banks. We had a glimpse now and then into the black depths
of the forest, where all was silent except the shrill stridulation
of wood-crickets. Now and then a sudden plunge in the water ahead
would startle us, caused by heavy fruit or some nocturnal animal
dropping from the trees. The two Indians here rested on their
paddles and allowed the canoe to drift with the tide. A pleasant
perfume came from the forest, which Raimundo said proceeded from a
cane-field. He told me that all this land was owned by large
proprietors at Par&aacute;, who had received grants from time to
time from the Government for political services. Raimundo was quite
in a talkative humour; he related to me many incidents of the time
of the &ldquo;Cabanagem,&rdquo; as the revolutionary days of 1835-6
are popularly called. He said he had been much suspected himself of
being a rebel, but declared that the suspicion was unfounded. The
only complaint he had to make against the white man was that he
monopolised the land without having any intention or prospect of
cultivating it. He had been turned out of one place where he had
squatted and cleared a large piece of forest. I believe the law of
Brazil at this time was that the new lands should become the
property of those who cleared and cultivated them, if their right
was not disputed within a given term of years by some one who
claimed the proprietorship. This land-law has since been repealed,
and a new one adopted founded on that of the United States.
Raimundo spoke of his race as the redskins, &ldquo;pelle
vermelho;&rdquo; they meant well to the whites, and only begged to
be let alone. &ldquo;God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;had given room
enough for us all.&rdquo; It was pleasant to hear the shrewd
good-natured fellow talk in this strain. Our companion, Joaquim,
had fallen asleep; the night air was cool, and the moonlight lit up
the features of Raimundo, revealing a more animated expression than
is usually observable in Indian countenances. I always noticed that
Indians were more cheerful on a voyage, especially in the cool
hours of night and morning, than when ashore. There is something in
their constitution of body which makes them feel excessively
depressed in the hot hours of the day, especially inside their
houses. Their skin is always hot to the touch. They certainly do
not endure the heat of their own climate so well as the whites. The
negroes are totally different in this respect; the heat of midday
has very little effect on them, and they dislike the cold nights on
the river.</p>

<p>We arrived at our hunting-ground about half-past four. The
channel was broader here and presented several ramifications. It
yet wanted an hour and a half to daybreak, so Raimundo recommended
me to have a nap. We both stretched ourselves on the benches of the
canoe and fell asleep, letting the boat drift with the tide, which
was now slack. I slept well considering the hardness of our bed,
and when I awoke in the middle of a dream about home-scenes, the
day was beginning to dawn. My clothes were quite wet with the dew.
The birds were astir, the cicadas had begun their music, and the
Urania Leilus, a strange and beautiful tailed and gilded moth,
whose habits are those of a butterfly, commenced to fly in flocks
over the tree-tops. Raimundo exclaimed &ldquo;Clareia o
dia!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The day brightens!&rdquo; The change was
rapid: the sky in the east assumed suddenly the loveliest azure
colour, across which streaks of thin white clouds were painted. It
is at such moments as this when one feels how beautiful our earth
truly is! The channel on whose waters our little boat was floating
was about two hundred yards wide; others branched off right and
left, surrounding the group of lonely islands which terminate the
land of Carnapij&oacute;. The forest on all sides formed a lofty
hedge without a break; below, it was fringed with mangrove bushes,
whose small foliage contrasted with the large glossy leaves of the
taller trees, or the feather and fan-shaped fronds of palms.</p>

<p>Being now arrived at our destination, Raimundo turned up his
trousers and shirt-sleeves, took his long hunting-knife, and leapt
ashore with the dogs. He had to cut a gap in order to enter the
forest. We expected to find Pacas and Cut&iacute;as; and the method
adopted to secure them was this: at the present early hour they
would be seen feeding on fallen fruits, but would quickly, on
hearing a noise, betake themselves to their burrows; Raimundo was
then to turn them out by means of the dogs, and Joaquim and I were
to remain in the boat with our guns, ready to shoot all that came
to the edge of the stream&mdash;the habits of both animals, when
hard-pressed, being to take to the water. We had not long to wait.
The first arrival was a Paca, a reddish, nearly tail-less rodent,
spotted with white on the sides, and intermediate in size and
appearance between a hog and a hare. My first shot did not take
effect; the animal dived into the water and did not reappear. A
second was brought down by my companion as it was rambling about
under the mangrove bushes. A Cut&iacute;a next appeared: this is
also a rodent, about one-third the size of the Paca; it swims, but
does not dive, and I was fortunate enough to shoot it. We obtained
in this way two more Pacas and another Cut&iacute;a. All the time
the dogs were yelping in the forest. Shortly afterwards Raimundo
made his appearance, and told us to paddle to the other side of the
island. Arrived there, we landed and prepared for breakfast. It was
a pretty spot&mdash;a clean, white, sandy beach beneath the shade
of wide-spreading trees. Joaquim made a fire. He first scraped fine
shavings from the midrib of a Bacaba palm-leaf; these he piled into
a little heap in a dry place, and then struck a light in his bamboo
tinderbox with a piece of an old file and a flint, the tinder being
a felt-like substance manufactured by an ant (Polyrhachis
bispinosus). By gentle blowing, the shavings ignited, dry sticks
were piled on them, and a good fire soon resulted. He then singed
and prepared the cut&iacute;a, finishing by running a spit through
the body and fixing one end in the ground in a slanting position
over the fire. We had brought with us a bag of farinha and a cup
containing a lemon, a dozen or two of fiery red peppers, and a few
spoonsful of salt. We breakfasted heartily when our cut&iacute;a
was roasted, and washed the meal down with a calabash full of the
pure water of the river.</p>

<p>After breakfast the dogs found another cutia, which was hidden
in its burrow two or three feet beneath the roots of a large tree,
and it took Raimundo nearly an hour to disinter it. Soon afterwards
we left this place, crossed the channel, and, paddling past two
islands, obtained a glimpse of the broad river between them, with a
long sandy spit, on which stood several scarlet ibises and
snow-white egrets. One of the islands was low and sandy, and half
of it was covered with gigantic arum-trees, the often-mentioned
Caladium arborescens, which presented a strange sight. Most people
are acquainted with the little British species, Arum maculatum,
which grows in hedge-bottoms, and many, doubtless, have admired the
larger kinds grown in hothouses; they can therefore form some idea
of a forest of arums. On this islet the woody stems of the plants
near the bottom were eight to ten inches in diameter, and the trees
were twelve to fifteen feet high; all growing together in such a
manner that there was just room for a man to walk freely between
them. There was a canoe inshore, with a man and a woman: the man,
who was hooting with all his might, told us in passing that his son
was lost in the &ldquo;aningal&rdquo; (arum-grove). He had strayed
whilst walking ashore, and the father had now been an hour waiting
for him in vain.</p>

<p>About one o&rsquo;clock we again stopped at the mouth of a
little creek. It was now intensely hot. Raimundo said deer were
found here; so he borrowed my gun, as being a more effective weapon
than the wretched arms called Lazarinos, which he, in common with
all the native hunters, used, and which sell at Par&aacute; for
seven or eight shillings apiece. Raimundo and Joaquim now stripped
themselves quite naked, and started off in different directions
through the forest, going naked in order to move with less noise
over the carpet of dead leaves, amongst which they stepped so
stealthily that not the slightest rustle could be heard. The dogs
remained in the canoe, in the neighbourhood of which I employed
myself two hours entomologising. At the end of that time my two
companions returned, having met with no game whatever.</p>

<p>We now embarked on our return voyage. Raimundo cut two slender
poles, one for a mast and the other for a sprit: to these he rigged
a sail we had brought in the boat, for we were to return by the
open river, and expected a good wind to carry us to Carip&iacute;.
As soon as we got out of the channel we began to feel the
wind&mdash;the sea-breeze, which here makes a clean sweep from the
Atlantic. Our boat was very small and heavily laden; and when,
after rounding a point, I saw the great breadth we had to traverse
(seven miles), I thought the attempt to cross in such a slight
vessel foolhardy in the extreme. The waves ran very high, there was
no rudder, Raimundo steered with a paddle, and all we had to rely
upon to save us from falling into the trough of the sea and being
instantly swamped were his nerve and skill. There was just room in
the boat for our three selves, the dogs, and the game we had
killed, and when between the swelling ridges of waves in so frail a
shell, our destruction seemed inevitable; as it was, we shipped a
little water now and then. Joaquim assisted with his paddle to
steady the boat: my time was fully occupied in bailing out the
water and watching the dogs, which were crowded together in the
prow, yelling with fear; one or other of them occasionally falling
over the side and causing great commotion in scrambling in again.
Off the point was a ridge of rocks, over which the surge raged
furiously. Raimundo sat at the stern, rigid and silent, his eye
steadily watching the prow of the boat. It was almost worth the
risk and discomfort of the passage to witness the seamanlike
ability displayed by Indians on the water. The little boat rode
beautifully, rising well with each wave, and in the course of an
hour and a half we arrived at Carip&iacute;, thoroughly tired and
wet through to the skin.</p>

<p>On the 16th of January, the dry season came abruptly to an end.
The sea-breezes, which had been increasing in force for some days,
suddenly ceased, and the atmosphere became misty; at length heavy
clouds collected where a uniform blue sky had for many weeks
prevailed, and down came a succession of heavy showers, the first
of which lasted a whole day and night. This seemed to give a new
stimulus to animal life. On the first night there was a tremendous
uproar&mdash;tree-frogs, crickets, goat-suckers, and owls all
joining to perform a deafening concert. One kind of goat-sucker
kept repeating at intervals throughout the night a phrase similar
to the Portuguese words, &ldquo;Joao corta
pao,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;John, cut wood&rdquo;&mdash;a phrase which
forms the Brazilian name of the bird. An owl in one of the Genipapa
trees muttered now and then a succession of syllables resembling
the word &ldquo;Murucutut&uacute;.&rdquo; Sometimes the croaking
and hooting of frogs and toads were so loud that we could not hear
one another&rsquo;s voices within doors. Swarms of dragonflies
appeared in the daytime about the pools of water created by the
rain, and ants and termites came forth in the winged state in vast
numbers. I noticed that the winged termites, or white ants, which
came by hundreds to the lamps at night, when alighting on the
table, often jerked off their wings by a voluntary movement. On
examination I found that the wings were not shed by the roots, for
a small portion of the stumps remained attached to the thorax. The
edge of the fracture was in all cases straight, not ruptured; there
is, in fact, a natural seam crossing the member towards its root,
and at this point the long wing naturally drops or is jerked off
when the insect has no further use for it. The white ant is endowed
with wings simply for the purpose of flying away from the colony
peopled by its wingless companions, to pair with individuals of the
same or other colonies, and thus propagate and disseminate its
kind. The winged individuals are males and females, whilst the
great bulk of their wingless fraternity are of no sex, but are of
two castes, soldiers and workers, which are restricted to the
functions of building the nests, nursing, and defending the young
brood. The two sexes mate whilst on the ground, after the wings are
shed; and then the married couples, if they escape the numerous
enemies which lie in wait for them, proceed to the task of founding
new colonies. Ants and white ants have much that is analogous in
their modes of life: they belong, however, to two widely different
orders of insects, strongly contrasted in their structure and
manner of growth.</p>

<p>I amassed at Carip&iacute; a very large collection of beautiful
and curious insects, amounting altogether to about twelve hundred
species. The number of Coleoptera was remarkable, seeing that this
order is so poorly represented near Par&aacute;. I attributed their
abundance to the number of new clearings made in the virgin forest
by the native settlers. The felled timber attracts lignivorous
insects, and these draw in their train the predaceous species of
various families. As a general rule, the species were smaller and
much less brilliant in colours than those of Mexico and South
Brazil. The species too, although numerous, were not represented by
great numbers of individuals; they were also extremely nimble, and
therefore much less easy of capture than insects of the same order
in temperate climates. The carnivorous beetles at Carip&iacute;
were, like those of Par&aacute;, chiefly arboreal. Most of them
exhibited a beautiful contrivance for enabling them to cling to and
run over smooth or flexible surfaces, such as leaves. Their tarsi
or feet are broad, and furnished beneath with a brush of short
stiff hairs; whilst their claws are toothed in the form of a comb,
adapting them for clinging to the smooth edges of leaves, the joint
of the foot which precedes the claw being cleft so as to allow free
play to the claw in grasping. The common dung-beetles at
Carip&iacute;, which flew about in the evening like the Geotrupes,
the familiar &ldquo;shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hum&rdquo;
of our English lanes, were of colossal size and beautiful colours.
One kind had a long spear-shaped horn projecting from the crown of
its head (Phan&aelig;us lancifer). A blow from this fellow, as he
came heavily flying along, was never very pleasant. All the tribes
of beetles which feed on vegetable substances, fresh or decayed,
were very numerous. The most beautiful of these, but not the most
common, were the Longicornes; very graceful insects, having slender
bodies and long antenn&aelig;, often ornamented with fringes and
tufts of hair. They were found on flowers, on trunks of trees, or
flying about the new clearings. One small species (Coremia
hirtipes) has a tuft of hairs on its hind legs, whilst many of its
sister species have a similar ornament on the antenn&aelig;. It
suggests curious reflections when we see an ornament like the
feather of a grenadier&rsquo;s cap situated on one part of the body
in one species, and in a totally different part in nearly allied
ones. I tried in vain to discover the use of these curious
brush-like decorations. On the trunk of a living leguminous tree,
Petzell found a number of a very rare and handsome species, the
Platysternus hebr&aelig;us, which is of a broad shape, coloured
ochreous, but spotted and striped with black, so as to resemble a
domino. On the felled trunks of trees, swarms of gilded-green
Longicornes occurred, of small size (Chrysoprasis), which looked
like miniature musk-beetles, and, indeed, are closely allied to
those well-known European insects.</p>

<p>At length, on the 12th of February, I left Carip&iacute;, my
Negro and Indian neighbours bidding me a warm &ldquo;adios.&rdquo;
I had passed a delightful time, notwithstanding the many privations
undergone in the way of food. The wet season had now set in; the
lowlands and islands would soon become flooded daily at high water,
and the difficulty of obtaining fresh provisions would increase. I
intended, therefore, to spend the next three months at Par&aacute;,
in the neighbourhood of which there was still much to be done in
the intervals of fine weather, and then start off on another
excursion into the interior.</p>
