<br>
<p class="first"><i>June, 1852.</i>&mdash;I will now proceed to
relate the incidents of my principal excursion up the Tapajos,
which I began to prepare for, after residing about six months at
Santarem.</p>

<p>I was obliged, this time, to travel in a vessel of my own;
partly because trading canoes large enough to accommodate a
Naturalist very seldom pass between Santarem and the thinly-peopled
settlements on the river, and partly because I wished to explore
districts at my ease, far out of the ordinary track of traders. I
soon found a suitable canoe; a two-masted cuberta, of about six
tons&rsquo; burthen, strongly built of Itauba or stonewood, a
timber of which all the best vessels in the Amazons country are
constructed, and said to be more durable than teak. This I hired of
a merchant at the cheap rate of 500 reis, or about one shilling and
twopence per day. I fitted up the cabin, which, as usual in canoes
of this class, was a square structure with its floor above the
waterline, as my sleeping and working apartment. My chests, filled
with store-boxes and trays for specimens, were arranged on each
side, and above them were shelves and pegs to hold my little stock
of useful books, guns, and game bags, boards and materials for
skinning and preserving animals, botanical press and papers, drying
cages for insects. and birds and so forth. A rush mat was spread on
the floor, and my rolled-up hammock, to be used only when sleeping
ashore, served for a pillow. The arched covering over the hold in
the fore part of the vessel contained, besides a sleeping place for
the crew, my heavy chests, stock of salt provisions and groceries,
and an assortment of goods wherewith to pay my way amongst the
half-civilised or savage inhabitants of the interior. The goods
consisted of cashaca, powder and shot, a few pieces of coarse,
checked cotton cloth and prints, fish-hooks, axes, large knives,
harpoons, arrowheads, looking-glasses, beads, and other small
wares. Jos&eacute; and myself were busy for many days arranging
these matters. We had to salt the meat and grind a supply of coffee
ourselves. Cooking utensils, crockery, water-jars, a set of useful
carpenter&rsquo;s tools, and many other things had to be provided.
We put all the groceries and other perishable articles in tin
canisters and boxes, having found that this was the only way of
preserving them from dampness and insects in this climate. When all
was done, our canoe looked like a little floating workshop.</p>

<p>I could get little information about the river, except vague
accounts of the difficulty of the navigation, and the famito or
hunger which reigned on its banks. As I have before mentioned, it
is about 1000 miles in length, and flows from south to north; in
magnitude it stands the sixth amongst the tributaries of the
Amazons. It is navigable, however, by sailing vessels only for
about 160 miles above Santarem. The hiring of men to navigate the
vessel was our greatest trouble. Jos&eacute; was to be my helmsman,
and we thought three other hands would be the fewest with which we
could venture. But all our endeavours to procure these were
fruitless. Santarem is worse provided with Indian canoemen than any
other town on the river. I found on applying to the tradesmen to
whom I had brought letters of introduction and to the Brazilian
authorities, that almost any favour would be sooner granted than
the loan of hands. A stranger, however, is obliged to depend on
them; for it is impossible to find an Indian or half-caste whom
someone or other of the head-men do not claim as owing him money or
labour. I was afraid at one time I should have been forced to
abandon my project on this account. At length, after many rebuffs
and disappointments, Jos&eacute; contrived to engage one man, a
mulatto, named Pinto, a native of the mining country of Interior
Brazil, who knew the river well; and with these two I resolved to
start, hoping to meet with others at the first village on the
road.</p>

<p>We left Santarem on the 8th of June. The waters were then at
their highest point, and my canoe had been anchored close to the
back door of our house. The morning was cool and a brisk wind blew,
with which we sped rapidly past the white-washed houses and
thatched Indian huts of the suburbs. The charming little bay of
Mapir&iacute; was soon left behind; we then doubled Point Maria
Josepha, a headland formed of high cliffs of Tabatinga clay, capped
with forest. This forms the limit of the river view from Santarem,
and here we had our last glimpse, at a distance of seven or eight
miles, of the city, a bright line of tiny white buildings resting
on the dark water. A stretch of wild, rocky, uninhabited coast was
before us, and we were fairly within the Tapajos.</p>

<p>Our course lay due west for about twenty miles. The wind
increased as we neared Point Curur&uacute;, where the river bends
from its northern course. A vast expanse of water here stretches to
the west and south, and the waves, with a strong breeze, run very
high. As we were doubling the Point, the cable which held our
montaria in tow astern, parted, and in endeavouring to recover the
boat, without which we knew it would be difficult to get ashore on
many parts of the coast, we were very near capsizing. We tried to
tack down the river; a vain attempt with a strong breeze and no
current. Our ropes snapped, the sails flew to rags, and the vessel,
which we now found was deficient in ballast, heeled over
frightfully. Contrary to Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s advice, I ran the
cuberta into a little bay, thinking to cast anchor there and wait
for the boat coming up with the wind; but the anchor dragged on the
smooth sandy bottom, and the vessel went broadside on to the rocky
beach. With a little dexterous management, but not until after we
had sustained some severe bumps, we managed to get out of this
difficulty, clearing the rocky point at a close shave with our
jib-sail. Soon after, we drifted into the smooth water of a
sheltered bay which leads to the charmingly situated village of
Altar do Chao; and we were obliged to give up our attempt to
recover the montaria.</p>

<p>The little settlement, Altar de Chao (altar of the ground, or
Earth altar), owes its singular name to the existence at the
entrance to the harbour of one of those strange flat-topped hills
which are so common in this part of the Amazons country, shaped
like the high altar in Roman Catholic churches. It is an isolated
one, and much lower in height than the similarly truncated hills
and ridges near Almeyrim, being elevated probably not more than 300
feet above the level of the river. It is bare of trees, but covered
in places with a species of fern. At the head of the bay is an
inner harbour, which communicates by a channel with a series of
lakes lying in the valleys between hills, and stretching far into
the interior of the land. The village is peopled almost entirely by
semi-civilised Indians, to the number of sixty or seventy families;
and the scattered houses are arranged in broad streets on a strip
of greensward, at the foot of a high, gloriously-wooded ridge.</p>

<p>I was so much pleased with the situation of this settlement, and
the number of rare birds and insects which tenanted the forest,
that I revisited it in the following year, and spent four months
making collections. The village itself is a neglected, poverty-
stricken place: the governor (Captain of Trabalhadores, or Indian
workmen) being an old, apathetic, half-breed, who had spent all his
life here. The priest was a most profligate character; I seldom saw
him sober; he was a white, however, and a man of good ability. I
may as well mention here, that a moral and zealous priest is a
great rarity in this province: the only ministers of religion in
the whole country who appeared sincere in their calling being the
Bishop of Para and the Vicars of Ega on the Upper Amazons and
Obydos. The houses in the village swarmed with vermin; bats in the
thatch, fire-ants (formiga de fogo) under the floors; cockroaches
and spiders on the walls. Very few of them had wooden doors and
locks. Altar de Chao was originally a settlement of the aborigines,
and was called Burar&iacute;. The Indians were always hostile to
the Portuguese, and during the disorders of 1835-6 joined the
rebels in their attack on Santarem. Few of them escaped the
subsequent slaughter, and for this reason there is now scarcely an
old or middle-aged man in the place. As in all the semi-civilised
villages, where the original orderly and industrious habits of the
Indian have been lost without anything being learned from the
whites to make amends, the inhabitants live in the greatest
poverty. The scarcity of fish in the clear waters and rocky bays of
the neighbourhood is no doubt partly the cause of the poverty and
perennial hunger which reign here. When we arrived in the port, our
canoe was crowded with the half-naked villagers&mdash;men, women,
and children, who came to beg each a piece of salt pirarucu
&ldquo;for the love of God.&rdquo; They are not quite so badly off
in the dry season. The shallow lakes and bays then contain plenty
of fish, and the boys and women go out at night to spear them by
torchlight; the torches being made of thin strips of green bark
from the leaf-stalks of palms, tied in bundles. Many excellent
kinds of fish are thus obtained; amongst them the Pescada, whose
white and flaky flesh, when boiled, has the appearance and flavour
of cod-fish; and the Tucunar&eacute; (Cichla temensis), a handsome
species, with a large prettily-coloured, eye-like spot on its tail.
Many small Salmonid&aelig; are also met with, and a kind of sole,
called Aramass&aacute;, which moves along the clear sandy bottom of
the bay. At these times a species of sting-ray is common on the
sloping beach, and bathers are frequently stung most severely by
it. The weapon of this fish is a strong blade with jagged edges,
about three inches long, growing from the side of the long fleshy
tail. I once saw a woman wounded by it whilst bathing; she shrieked
frightfully, and was obliged to be carried to her hammock, where
she lay for a week in great pain; I have known strong men to be
lamed for many months by the sting.</p>

<p>There was a mode of taking fish here which I had not before seen
employed, but found afterwards to be very common on the Tapajos.
This is by using a poisonous liana called Timb&oacute; (Paullinia
pinnata). It will act only in the still waters of creeks and pools.
A few rods, a yard in length, are mashed and soaked in the water,
which quickly becomes discoloured with the milky deleterious juice
of the plant. In about half an hour all the smaller fishes over a
rather wide space around the spot, rise to the surface floating on
their sides, and with the gills wide open. The poison acts
evidently by suffocating the fishes; it spreads slowly in the
water, and a very slight mixture seems sufficient to stupefy them.
I was surprised, upon beating the water in places where no fishes
were visible in the clear depths for many yards round, to find,
sooner or later, sometimes twenty-four hours afterwards, a
considerable number floating dead on the surface.</p>

<p>The people occupy themselves the greater part of the year with
their small plantations of mandioca. All the heavy work, such as
felling and burning the timber, planting and weeding, is done in
the plantation of each family by a congregation of neighbours,
which they call a &ldquo;pucherum:&rdquo;&mdash;a similar custom to
the &ldquo;bee&rdquo; in the backwood settlements of North America.
They make quite a holiday of each pucherum. When the invitation is
issued, the family prepares a great quantity of fermented drink,
called in this part Tarob&aacute;, made from soaked mandioca cakes,
and porridge of Manicueira. This latter is a kind of sweet
mandioca, very different from the Yuca of the Peruvians and
Macasheira of the Brazilians (Manihot Aypi), having oblong juicy
roots, which become very sweet a few days after they are gathered.
With these simple provisions they regale their helpers. The work is
certainly done, but after a very rude fashion; all become soddened
with Tarob&aacute;, and the day finishes often in a drunken
brawl.</p>

<p>The climate is rather more humid than that of Santarem. I
suppose this is to be attributed to the neighbouring country being
densely wooded instead of an open campo. In no part of the country
did I enjoy more the moonlit nights than here, in the dry season.
After the day&rsquo;s work was done, I used to go down to the
shores of the bay, and lie at full length on the cool sand for two
or three hours before bedtime. The soft pale light, resting on
broad sandy beaches and palm-thatched huts, reproduced the effect
of a mid-winter scene in the cold north when a coating of snow lies
on the landscape. A heavy shower falls about once a week, and the
shrubby vegetation never becomes parched as at Santarem. Between
the rains, the heat and dryness increase from day to day: the
weather on the first day after the rain is gleamy, with intervals
of melting sunshine and passing clouds; the next day is rather
drier, and the east wind begins to blow; then follow days of
cloudless sky, with gradually increasing strength of breeze. When
this has continued about a week, a light mistiness begins to gather
about the horizon; clouds are formed; grumbling thunder is heard;
and then, generally in the night-time, down falls the refreshing
rain. The sudden chill caused by the rains produces colds, which
are accompanied by the same symptoms as in our own climate; with
this exception, the place is very healthy.</p>

<br>
<p><i>June 17th.</i>&mdash;The two young men returned without
meeting with my montaria, and I found it impossible here to buy a
new one. Captain Thom&aacute;s could find me only one hand. This
was a blunt- spoken but willing young Indian, named Manoel. He came
on board this morning at eight o&rsquo;clock, and we then got up
our anchor and resumed our voyage.</p>

<p>The wind was light and variable all day, and we made only about
fifteen miles by seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening. The coast
formed a succession of long, shallow bays with sandy beaches, upon
which the waves broke in a long line of surf. Ten miles above Altar
de Chao is a conspicuous headland, called Point Cajet&uacute;ba.
During a lull of the wind, towards midday, we ran the cuberta
aground in shallow water and waded ashore; but the woods were
scarcely penetrable, and not a bird was to be seen. The only thing
observed worthy of note was the quantity of drowned winged ants
along the beach; they were all of one species, the terrible formiga
de fogo (Myrmica s&aelig;vissima); the dead, or half-dead bodies of
which were heaped up in a line an inch or two in height and
breadth, the line continuing without interruption for miles at the
edge of the water. The countless thousands had been doubtless cast
into the river whilst flying during a sudden squall the night
before, and afterwards, cast ashore by the waves. We found
ourselves at seven o&rsquo;clock near the mouth of a creek leading
to a small lake, called Aram&aacute;na-&iacute;, and the wind
having died away, we anchored, guided by the lights ashore, near
the house of a settler named Jeronymo, whom I knew, and who, soon
after, showed us a snug little harbour where we could remain in
safety for the night. The river here cannot be less than ten miles
broad; it is quite clear of islands and free from shoals at this
season of the year. The opposite coast appeared in the daytime as a
long thin line of forest, with dim grey hills in the
background.</p>

<p>To-day (19th) we had a good wind, which carried us to the mouth
of a creek, culled Paquiat&uacute;ba, where the
&ldquo;inspector&rdquo; of the district lived, Senhor Cypriano, for
whom I had brought an order from Captain Thom&aacute;s to supply me
with another hand. We had great difficulty in finding a place to
land. The coast in this part was a tract of level, densely-wooded
country, through which flowed the winding rivulet, or creek, which
gives its name to a small scattered settlement hidden in the
wilderness; the hills here receding two or three miles towards the
interior. A large portion of the forest was flooded, the trunks of
the very high trees near the mouth of the creek standing eighteen
feet deep in water. We lost two hours working our way with poles
through the inundated woods in search of the port. Every inlet we
tried ended in a labyrinth choked up with bushes, but we were at
length guided to the right place by the crowing of cocks. On
shouting for a montaria, an Indian boy made his appearance, guiding
one through the gloomy thickets; but he was so alarmed, I suppose
at the apparition of a strange-looking white man in spectacles
bawling from the brow of the vessel, that he shot back quickly into
the bushes. He returned when Manoel spoke, and we went ashore: the
montaria winding along a gloomy overshadowed water-path made by
cutting away the lower branches and underwood. The foot-road to the
houses was a narrow, sandy alley, bordered by trees of stupendous
height, overrun with creepers, and having an unusual number of long
air-roots dangling from the epiphytes on their branches.</p>

<p>After passing one low smoky little hut half-buried in foliage,
the path branched off in various directions, and the boy having
left us, we took the wrong turn. We were brought to a stand soon
after by the barking of dogs; and on shouting, as is customary on
approaching a dwelling, &ldquo;O da casa!&rdquo; (Oh of the house!)
a dark- skinned native, a Cafuzo, with a most unpleasant expression
of countenance, came forth through the tangled maze of bushes,
armed with a long knife, with which he pretended to be whittling a
stick. He directed us to the house of Cypriano, which was about a
mile distant along another forest road. The circumstance of the
Cafuzo coming out armed to receive visitors very much astonished my
companions, who talked it over at every place we visited for
several days afterwards, the freest and most unsuspecting welcome
in these retired places being always counted upon by strangers.
But, as Manoel remarked, the fellow may have been one of the
unpardoned rebel leaders who had settled here after the recapture
of Santarem in 1836, and lived in fear of being inquired for by the
authorities of Santarem. After all our troubles we found Cypriano
absent from home. His house was a large one, and full of people,
old and young, women and children, all of whom were Indians or
mamelucos. Several smaller huts surrounded the large dwelling,
besides extensive open sheds containing mandioca ovens and rude
wooden mills for grinding sugar-cane to make molasses. All the
buildings were embosomed in trees: it would be scarcely possible to
find a more retired nook, and an air of contentment was spread over
the whole establishment. Cypriano&rsquo;s wife, a good- looking
mameluco girl, was superintending the packing of farina. Two or
three old women, seated on mats, were making baskets with narrow
strips of bark from the leaf-stalks of palms, whilst others were
occupied lining them with the broad leaves of a species of maranta,
and filling them afterwards with farina, which was previously
measured in a rude square vessel. It appeared that Senhor Cypriano
was a large producer of the article, selling 300 baskets (sixty
pounds&rsquo; weight each) annually to Santarem traders. I was
sorry we were unable to see him, but it was useless waiting, as we
were told all the men were at present occupied in
&ldquo;pucherums,&rdquo; and he would be unable to give me the
assistance I required. We returned to the canoe in the evening,
and, after moving out into the river, anchored and slept.</p>

<p><i>June 20th.</i>&mdash;We had a light, baffling wind off shore
all day on the 20th, and made but fourteen or fifteen miles by six
p.m.; when, the wind failing us, we anchored at the mouth of a
narrow channel, called Tapai&uacute;na, which runs between a large
island and the mainland. About three o&rsquo;clock we passed in
front of Boim, a village on the opposite (western) coast. The
breadth of the river here is six or seven miles: a confused patch
of white on the high land opposite was all we saw of the village,
the separate houses being undistinguishable on account of the
distance. The coast along which we sailed today is a continuation
of the low and flooded land of Paquiat&uacute;ba.</p>

<p><i>June 21st.</i>&mdash;The next morning we sailed along the
Tapai&uacute;na channel, which is from 400 to 600 yards in breadth.
We advanced but slowly, as the wind was generally dead against us,
and stopped frequently to ramble ashore. Wherever the landing-place
was sandy, it was impossible to walk about on account of the swarms
of the terrible fire-ant, whose sting is likened by the Brazilians
to the puncture of a red-hot needle. There was scarcely a square
inch of ground free from them. About three p.m. we glided into a
quiet, shady creek, on whose banks an industrious white settler had
located himself. I resolved to pass the rest of the day and night
here, and endeavour to obtain a fresh supply of provisions, our
stock of salt beef being now nearly exhausted. The situation of the
house was beautiful; the little harbour being gay with water
plants, Pontederi&aelig;, now full of purple blossom, from which
flocks of stilt-legged water-fowl started up screaming as we
entered. The owner sent a boy with my men to show them the best
place for fish up the creek, and in the course of the evening sold
me a number of fowls, besides baskets of beans and farina. The
result of the fishing was a good supply of Jandi&aacute;, a
handsome spotted Siluride fish, and Pir&aacute;nha, a kind of
Salmon. Pir&aacute;nhas are of several kinds, many of which abound
in the waters of the Tapajos. They are caught with almost any kind
of bait, for their taste is indiscriminate and their appetite most
ravenous. They often attack the legs of bathers near the shore,
inflicting severe wounds with their strong triangular teeth. At
Paquiat&uacute;ba and this place, I added about twenty species of
small fishes to my collection; caught by hook and line, or with the
hand in shallow pools under the shade of the forest.</p>

<p>My men slept ashore, and upon the coming aboard in the morning,
Pinto was drunk and insolent. According to Jos&eacute;, who had
kept himself sober, and was alarmed at the other&rsquo;s violent
conduct, the owner of the house and Pinto had spent the greater
part of the night together, drinking aguardente de
beij&uacute;,&mdash;a spirit distilled from the mandioca root. We
knew nothing of the antecedents of this man, who was a tall,
strong, self-willed fellow, and it began to dawn on us that this
was not a very safe travelling companion in a wild country like
this. I thought it better now to make the best of our way to the
next settlement, Aveyros, and get rid of him. Our course to-day lay
along a high rocky coast, which extended without a break for about
eight miles. The height of the perpendicular rocks was from 100 to
150 feet; ferns and flowering shrubs grew in the crevices, and the
summit supported a luxuriant growth of forest, like the rest of the
river banks. The waves beat with a loud roar at the foot of these
inhospitable barriers. At two p.m. we passed the mouth of a small
picturesque harbour, formed by a gap in the precipitous coast.
Several families have here settled; the place is called
It&aacute;-pu&aacute;ma, or &ldquo;standing rock,&rdquo; from a
remarkable isolated cliff, which stands erect at the entrance to
the little haven. A short distance beyond It&aacute;-pu&aacute;ma
we found ourselves opposite to the village of Pinhel, which is
perched, like Boim, on high ground, on the western side of the
river. The stream is here from six to seven miles wide. A line of
low islets extends in front of Pinhel, and a little further to the
south is a larger island, called Capitar&iacute;, which lies nearly
in the middle of the river.</p>

<p><i>June 23rd.</i>&mdash;The wind freshened at ten o&rsquo;clock
in the morning of the 23rd. A thick black cloud then began to
spread itself over the sky a long way down the river; the storm
which it portended, however, did not reach us, as the dark
threatening mass crossed from east to west, and the only effect it
had was to impel a column of cold air up river, creating a breeze
with which we bounded rapidly forward. The wind in the afternoon
strengthened to a gale; we carried on with one foresail only, two
of the men holding on to the boom to prevent the whole thing from
flying to pieces. The rocky coast continued for about twelve miles
above It&aacute;-pu&aacute;ma, then succeeded a tract of low marshy
land, which had evidently been once an island whose channel of
separation from the mainland had become silted up. The island of
Capitar&iacute; and another group of islets succeeding it, called
Jacar&eacute;, on the opposite side, helped also to contract at
this point the breadth of the river, which was now not more than
about three miles. The little cuberta almost flew along this coast,
there being no perceptible current, past extensive swamps, margined
with thick floating grasses. At length, on rounding a low point,
higher land again appeared on the right bank of the river, and the
village of Aveyros hove in sight, in the port of which we cast
anchor late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Aveyros is a small settlement, containing only fourteen or
fifteen houses besides the church; but it is the place of residence
of the authorities of a large district; the priest, Juiz de Paz,
the subdelegado of police, and the Captain of the Trabalhadores.
The district includes Pinhel, which we passed about twenty miles
lower down on the left bank of the river. Five miles beyond
Aveyros, and also on the left bank, is the missionary village of
Santa Cruz, comprising thirty or forty families of baptised
Munduruc&uacute; Indians, who are at present under the management
of a Capuchin Friar, and are independent of the Captain of
Trabalhadores of Aveyros. The river view from this point towards
the south was very grand; the stream is from two to three miles
broad, with green islets resting on its surface, and on each side a
chain of hills stretches away in long perspective. I resolved to
stay here for a few weeks to make collections. On landing, my first
care was to obtain a house or room, that I might live ashore. This
was soon arranged; the head man of the place, Captain Antonio,
having received notice of my coming, so that before night all the
chests and apparatus I required were housed and put in order for
working.</p>

<p>I here dismissed Pinto, who again got drunk and quarrelsome a
few hours after he came ashore. He left the next day, to my great
relief, in a small trading canoe that touched at the place on its
way to Santarem. The Indian Manoel took his leave at the same time,
having engaged to accompany me only as far as Aveyros; I was then
dependent on Captain Antonio for fresh hands. The captains of
Trabalhadores are appointed by the Brazilian Government to embody
the scattered Indian labourers and canoe-men of their respective
districts, to the end that they may supply passing travellers with
men when required. A semi-military organisation is given to the
bodies; some of the steadiest amongst the Indians themselves being
nominated as sergeants, and all the members mustered at the
principal village of their district twice a-year. The captains,
however, universally abuse their authority, monopolising the
service of the men for their own purposes, so that it is only by
favour that the loan of a canoe-hand can be wrung from them. I was
treated by Captain Antonio with great consideration, and promised
two good Indians when I should be ready to continue my voyage.</p>

<p>Little happened worth narrating during my forty days&rsquo; stay
at Aveyros. The time was spent in the quiet, regular pursuit of
Natural History: every morning I had my long ramble in the forest,
which extended to the back-doors of the houses, and the afternoons
were occupied in preserving and studying the objects collected. The
priest was a lively old man, but rather a bore from being able to
talk of scarcely anything except homoeopathy, having been smitten
with the mania during a recent visit to Santarem. He had a
Portuguese Homoeopathic Dictionary, and a little leather case
containing glass tubes filled with globules, with which he was
doctoring the whole village. A bitter enmity seemed to exist
between the female members of the priest&rsquo;s family, and those
of the captain&rsquo;s; the only white women in the settlement. It
was amusing to notice how they flaunted past each other, when going
to church on Sundays, in their starched muslin dresses. I found an
intelligent young man living here, a native of the province of
Goyaz, who was exploring the neighbourhood for gold and diamonds.
He had made one journey up a branch river, and declared to me that
he had found one diamond, but was unable to continue his
researches, because the Indians who accompanied him refused to
remain any longer; he was now waiting for Captain Antonio to assist
him with fresh men, having offered him in return a share in the
results of the enterprise. There appeared to be no doubt that gold
is occasionally found within two or three days&rsquo; journey of
Aveyros; but all lengthened search is made impossible by the
scarcity of food and the impatience of the Indians, who see no
value in the precious metal, and abhor the tediousness of the
gold-searcher&rsquo;s occupation. It is impossible to do without
them, as they are required to paddle the canoes.</p>

<p>The weather, during the month of July, was uninterruptedly fine;
not a drop of rain fell, and the river sank rapidly. The mornings,
for two hours after sunrise, were very cold; we were glad to wrap
ourselves in blankets on turning out of our hammocks, and walk
about at a quick pace in the early sunshine. But in the afternoons,
the heat was sickening, for the glowing sun then shone full on the
front of the row of whitewashed houses, and there was seldom any
wind to moderate its effects. I began now to understand why the
branch rivers of the Amazons were so unhealthy, whilst the main
stream was pretty nearly free from diseases arising from malaria.
The cause lies, without doubt, in the slack currents of the
tributaries in the dry season, and the absence of the cooling
Amazonian trade-wind, which purifies the air along the banks of the
main river. The trade-wind does not deviate from its nearly
straight westerly course, so that the branch streams, which run
generally at right angles to the Amazons, and, have a slack current
for a long distance from their mouths, are left to the horrors of
nearly stagnant air and water.</p>

<p>Aveyros may be called the head-quarters of the fire-ant, which
might be fittingly termed the scourge of this fine river. The
Tapajos is nearly free from the insect pests of other parts,
mosquitoes, sand-flies, Mot&uacute;cas and piums; but the formiga
de fogo is perhaps a greater plague than all the others put
together. It is found only on sandy soils in open places, and seems
to thrive most in the neighbourhood of houses and weedy villages,
such as Aveyros; it does not occur at all in the shades of the
forest. I noticed it in most places on the banks of the Amazons but
the species is not very common on the main river, and its presence
is there scarcely noticed, because it does not attack man, and the
sting is not so virulent as it is in the same species on the banks
of the Tapajos. Aveyros was deserted a few years before my visit on
account of this little tormentor, and the inhabitants had only
recently returned to their houses, thinking its numbers had
decreased. It is a small species, of a shining reddish colour not
greatly differing from the common red stinging ant of our own
country (Myrmica rubra), except that the pain and irritation caused
by its sting are much greater. The soil of the whole village is
undermined by it; the ground is perforated with the entrances to
their subterranean galleries, and a little sandy dome occurs here
and there, where the insects bring their young to receive warmth
near the surface. The houses are overrun with them; they dispute
every fragment of food with the inhabitants, and destroy clothing
for the sake of the starch. All eatables are obliged to be
suspended in baskets from the rafters, and the cords well soaked
with copauba balsam, which is the only means known of preventing
them from climbing. They seem to attack persons out of sheer
malice; if we stood for a few moments in the street, even at a
distance from their nests, we were sure to be overrun and severely
punished, for the moment an ant touched the flesh, he secured
himself with his jaws, doubled in his tail, and stung with all his
might. When we were seated on chairs in the evenings in front of
the house to enjoy a chat with our neighbours, we had stools to
support our feet, the legs of which, as well as those of the
chairs, were well anointed with the balsam. The cords of hammocks
are obliged to be smeared in the same way to prevent the ants from
paying sleepers a visit.</p>

<p>The inhabitants declare that the fire-ant was unknown on the
Tapajos before the disorders of 1835-6, and believe that the hosts
sprang up from the blood of the slaughtered Cabanas or rebels. They
have doubtless increased since that time, but the cause lies in the
depopulation of the villages and the rank growth of weeds in the
previously cleared, well-kept spaces. I have already described the
line of sediment formed on the sandy shores lower down the river by
the dead bodies of the winged individuals of this species. The
exodus from their nests of the males and females takes place at the
end of the rainy season (June), when the swarms are blown into the
river by squalls of wind, and subsequently cast ashore by the
waves; I was told that this wholesale destruction of ant-life takes
place annually, and that the same compact heap of dead bodies which
I saw only in part, extends along the banks of the river for twelve
or fifteen miles.</p>

<p>The forest behind Aveyros yielded me little except insects, but
in these it was very rich. It is not too dense, and broad sunny
paths skirted by luxuriant beds of Lycopodiums, which form
attractive sporting places for insects, extend from the village to
a swampy hollow or ygap&oacute;, which lies about a mile inland. Of
butterflies alone I enumerated fully 300 species, captured or seen
in the course of forty days within a half-hour&rsquo;s walk of the
village. This is a greater number than is found in the whole of
Europe. The only monkey I observed was the Callithrix
moloch&mdash;one of the kinds called by the Indians
&ldquo;Whai&aacute;pu-sa&iacute;&rdquo;. It is a moderate-sized
species, clothed with long brown hair, and having hands of a
whitish hue. Although nearly allied to the Cebi, it has none of
their restless vivacity, but is a dull listless animal. It goes in
small flocks of five or six individuals, running along the main
boughs of the trees. One of the specimens which I obtained here was
caught on a low fruit-tree at the back of our house at sunrise one
morning. This was the only instance of a monkey being captured in
such a position that I ever heard of. As the tree was isolated, it
must have descended to the ground from the neighbouring forest and
walked some distance to get at it. The species is sometimes kept in
a tame state by the natives: it does not make a very amusing pet,
and survives captivity only a short time.</p>

<p>I heard that the white Cebus, the Caiar&aacute;ra branca, a kind
of monkey I had not yet seen, and wished very much to obtain,
inhabited the forests on the opposite side of the river; so one
day, on an opportunity being afforded by our host going over in a
large boat, I crossed to go in search of it. We were about twenty
persons in all, and the boat was an old rickety affair with the
gaping seams rudely stuffed with tow and pitch. In addition to the
human freight we took three sheep with us, which Captain Antonio
had just received from Santarem and was going to add to his new
cattle farm on the other side. Ten Indian paddlers carried us
quickly across. The breadth of the river could not be less than
three miles, and the current was scarcely perceptible. When a boat
has to cross the main Amazons, it is obliged to ascend along the
banks for half a mile or more to allow for drifting by the current;
in this lower part of the Tapajos this is not necessary. When about
halfway, the sheep, in moving about, kicked a hole in the bottom of
the boat. The passengers took the matter very coolly, although the
water spouted up alarmingly, and I thought we should inevitably be
swamped. Captain Antonio took off his socks to stop the leak,
inviting me and the Juiz de Paz, who was one of the party, to do
the same, whilst two Indians baled out the water with large cuyas.
We thus managed to keep afloat until we reached our destination,
when the men patched up the leak for our return journey.</p>

<p>The landing-place lay a short distance within the mouth of a
shady inlet, on whose banks, hidden amongst the dense woods, were
the houses of a few Indian and mameluco settlers. The path to the
cattle farm led first through a tract of swampy forest; it then
ascended a slope and emerged on a fine sweep of prairie, varied
with patches of timber. The wooded portion occupied the hollows
where the soil was of a rich chocolate-brown colour, and of a peaty
nature. The higher grassy, undulating parts of the campo had a
lighter and more sandy soil. Leaving our friends, Jos&eacute; and I
took our guns and dived into the woods in search of the monkeys. As
we walked rapidly along I was very near treading on a rattlesnake,
which lay stretched out nearly in a straight line on the bare sandy
pathway. It made no movement to get out of the way, and I escaped
the danger by a timely and sudden leap, being unable to check my
steps in the hurried walk. We tried to excite the sluggish reptile
by throwing handsfull of sand and sticks at it, but the only notice
it took was to raise its ugly horny tail and shake its rattle. At
length it began to move rather nimbly, when we despatched it by a
blow on the head with a pole, not wishing to fire on account of
alarming our game.</p>

<p>We saw nothing of the white Caiar&aacute;ra; we met, however,
with a flock of the common light-brown allied species (Cebus
albifrons?), and killed one as a specimen. A resident on this side
of the river told us that the white kind was found further to the
south, beyond Santa Cruz. The light-brown Caiar&aacute;ra is pretty
generally distributed over the forests of the level country. I saw
it very frequently on the banks of the Upper Amazons, where it was
always a treat to watch a flock leaping amongst the trees, for it
is the most wonderful performer in this line of the whole tribe.
The troops consist of thirty or more individuals, which travel in
single file. When the foremost of the flock reaches the outermost
branch of an unusually lofty tree, he springs forth into the air
without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation and alights on the dome of
yielding foliage belonging to the neighbouring tree, maybe fifty
feet beneath; all the rest following the example. They grasp, upon
falling, with hands and tail, right themselves in a moment, and
then away they go along branch and bough to the next tree. The
Caiar&aacute;ra owes its name in the Tup&iacute; language, macaw or
large-headed (Acain, head, and Ar&aacute;ra macaw), to the
disproportionate size of the head compared with the rest of the
body. It is very frequently kept as a pet in houses of natives. I
kept one myself for about a year, which accompanied me in my
voyages and became very familiar, coming to me always on wet nights
to share my blanket. It is a most restless creature, but is not
playful like most of the American monkeys; the restlessness of its
disposition seeming to arise from great nervous irritability and
discontent. The anxious, painful, and changeable expression of its
countenance, and the want of purpose in its movements, betray this.
Its actions are like those of a wayward child; it does not seem
happy even when it has plenty of its favourite food, bananas; but
will leave its own meal to snatch the morsels out of the hands of
its companions. It differs in these mental traits from its nearest
kindred, for another common Cebus, found in the same parts of the
forest, the Prego monkey (Cebus cirrhifer?), is a much quieter and
better-tempered animal; it is full of tricks, but these are
generally of a playful character.</p>

<p>The Caiar&aacute;ra keeps the house in a perpetual uproar where
it is kept: when alarmed, or hungry, or excited by envy, it screams
piteously; it is always, however, making some noise or other, often
screwing up its mouth and uttering a succession of loud notes
resembling a whistle. My little pet, when loose, used to run after
me, supporting itself for some distance on its hind legs, without,
however, having been taught to do it. He offended me greatly one
day, by killing, in one of his jealous fits, another and much
choicer pet&mdash;the nocturnal owl-faced monkey (Nyctipithecus
trivirgatus). Someone had given this a fruit, which the other
coveted, so the two got to quarrelling. The Nyctipithecus fought
only with its paws, clawing out and hissing like a cat; the other
soon obtained the mastery, and before I could interfere, finished
his rival by cracking its skull with his teeth. Upon this, I got
rid of him.</p>

<p>On recrossing the river to Aveyros in the evening, a pretty
little parrot fell from a great height headlong into the water near
the boat, having dropped from a flock which seemed to be fighting
in the air. One of the Indians secured it for me, and I was
surprised to find the bird uninjured. There had probably been a
quarrel about mates, resulting in our little stranger being
temporarily stunned by a blow on the head from the beak of a
jealous comrade. The species was the Conurus guianensis, called by
the natives Maracan&aacute;; the plumage green, with a patch of
scarlet under the wings. I wished to keep the bird alive and tame
it, but all our efforts to reconcile it to captivity were vain; it
refused food, bit everyone who went near it, and damaged its
plumage in its exertions to free itself. My friends in Aveyros said
that this kind of parrot never became domesticated. After trying
nearly a week I was recommended to lend the intractable creature to
an old Indian woman, living in the village, who was said to be a
skilful bird-tamer. In two days she brought it back almost as tame
as the familiar love-birds of our aviaries. I kept my little pet
for upwards of two years; it learned to talk pretty well, and was
considered quite a wonder as being a bird usually so difficult of
domestication. I do not know what arts the old woman used: Captain
Antonio said she fed it with her saliva. The chief reason why
almost all animals become so wonderfully tame in the houses of the
natives is, I believe, their being treated with uniform gentleness,
and allowed to run at large about the rooms. Our Maracan&aacute;
used to accompany us sometimes in our rambles, one of the lads
carrying it on his head. One day, in the middle of a long forest
road, it was missed, having clung probably to an overhanging bough
and escaped into the thicket without the boy perceiving it. Three
hours afterwards, on our return by the same path, a voice greeted
using a colloquial tone as we passed &ldquo;Maracan&aacute;!&rdquo;
We looked about for some time, but could not see anything, until
the word was repeated with emphasis
&ldquo;Maracan&aacute;-&aacute;!&rdquo; When we espied the little
truant half concealed in the foliage of a tree, he came down and
delivered himself up, evidently as much rejoiced at the meeting as
we were.</p>

<p>After I had obtained the two men promised, stout young Indians,
seventeen or eighteen years of age, one named Ricardo and the other
Alberto, I paid a second visit to the western side of the river in
my own canoe; being determined, if possible, to obtain specimens of
the White Cebus. We crossed over first to the mission village,
Santa Cruz, which consists of thirty or forty wretched-looking mud
huts, closely built together in three straight ugly rows on a high
gravelly bank. The place was deserted, with the exception of two or
three old men and women and a few children. A narrow belt of wood
runs behind the village; beyond this is an elevated, barren campo
with a clayey and gravelly soil. To the south, the coast country is
of a similar description; a succession of scantily-wooded hills,
bare grassy spaces, and richly-timbered hollows. We traversed
forest and campo in various directions during three days without
meeting with monkeys, or indeed with anything that repaid us the
time and trouble. The soil of the district appeared too dry; at
this season of the year I had noticed, in other parts of the
country, that mammals and birds resorted to the more humid areas of
forest; we therefore proceeded to explore carefully the low and
partly swampy tract along the coast to the north of Santa Cruz. We
spent two days in this way landing at many places, and penetrating
a good distance in the interior. Although unsuccessful with regard
to the White Cebus, the time was not wholly lost, as I added
several small birds of species new to my collection. On the second
evening we surprised a large flock, composed of about fifty
individuals, of a curious eagle with a very long and slender hooked
beak, the Rostrhamus hamatus. They were perched on the bushes which
surrounded a shallow lagoon, separated from the river by a belt of
floating grass; my men said they fed on toads and lizards found at
the margins of pools. They formed a beautiful sight as they flew up
and wheeled about at a great height in the air. We obtained only
one specimen.</p>

<p>Before returning to Aveyros, we paid another visit to the
Jacar&eacute; inlet, leading to Captain Antonio&rsquo;s cattle
farm, for the sake of securing further specimens of the many rare
and handsome insects found there; landing at the port of one of the
settlers. The owner of the house was not at home, and the wife, a
buxom young woman, a dark mameluca, with clear though dark
complexion and fine rosy cheeks, was preparing, in company with
another stout-built Amazon, her rod and lines to go out fishing for
the day&rsquo;s dinner. It was now the season for Tucunar&eacute;s,
and Senora Joaquina showed us the fly baits used to take this kind
of fish, which she had made with her own hands of parrots&rsquo;
feathers. The rods used are slender bamboos, and the lines made
from the fibres of pine-apple leaves. It is not very common for the
Indian and half-caste women to provide for themselves in the way
these spirited dames were doing, although they are all expert
paddlers, and very frequently cross wide rivers in their frail
boats without the aid of men. It is possible that parties of Indian
women, seen travelling alone in this manner, may have given rise to
the fable of a nation of Amazons, invented by the first Spanish
explorers of the country. Senhora Joaquina invited me and
Jos&eacute; to a Tucunar&eacute; dinner for the afternoon, and then
shouldering their paddles and tucking up their skirts, the two
dusky fisherwomen marched down to their canoe. We sent the two
Indians into the woods to cut palm-leaves to mend the thatch of our
cuberta, whilst Jos&eacute; and I rambled through the woods which
skirted the campo. On our return, we found a most bountiful spread
in the house of our hostess. A spotless white cloth was laid on the
mat, with a plate for each guest and a pile of fragrant, newly-made
farinha by the side of it. The boiled Tucunar&eacute;s were soon
taken from the kettles and set before us. I thought the men must be
happy husbands who owned such wives as these. The Indian and
mameluco women certainly do make excellent managers; they are more
industrious than the men, and most of them manufacture farinha for
sale on their own account, their credit always standing higher with
the traders on the river than that of their male connections. I was
quite surprised at the quantity of fish they had taken; there being
sufficient for the whole party, including several children, two old
men from a neighbouring hut, and my Indians. I made our
good-natured entertainers a small present of needles and
sewing-cotton, articles very much prized, and soon after we
re-embarked, and again crossed the river to Aveyros.</p>

<p><i>August 2nd.</i>&mdash;Left Aveyros; having resolved to ascend
a branch river, the Cupar&iacute;, which enters the Tapajos about
eight miles above this village, instead of going forward along the
main stream. I should have liked to visit the settlements of the
Munduruc&uacute; tribe which lie beyond the first cataract of the
Tapajos, if it had been compatible with the other objects I had in
view. But to perform this journey a lighter canoe than mine would
have been necessary, and six or eight Indian paddlers, which in my
case it was utterly impossible to obtain. There would be, however,
an opportunity of seeing this fine race of people on the
Cupar&iacute;, as a horde was located towards the head waters of
this stream. The distance from Aveyros to the last civilised
settlement on the Tapajos, Itaituba, is about forty miles. The
falls commence a short distance beyond this place. Ten formidable
cataracts or rapids then succeed each other at intervals of a few
miles, the chief of which are the Coait&aacute;, the Bubur&eacute;,
the Salto Grande (about thirty feet high), and the Montanha. The
canoes of Cuyab&aacute; tradesmen which descend annually to
Santarem are obliged to be unloaded at each of these, and the
cargoes carried by land on the backs of Indians, whilst the empty
vessels are dragged by ropes over the obstruction. The
Cupar&iacute; was described to me as flowing through a rich, moist
clayey valley covered with forests and abounding in game; whilst
the banks of the Tapajos beyond Aveyros were barren sandy campos,
with ranges of naked or scantily-wooded hills, forming a kind of
country which I had always found very unproductive in Natural
History objects in the dry season, which had now set in.</p>

<p>We entered the mouth of the Cupar&iacute; on the evening of the
following day (August 3rd). It was not more than a hundred yards
wide, but very deep: we found no bottom in the middle with a line
of eight fathoms. The banks were gloriously wooded, the familiar
foliage of the cacao growing abundantly amongst the mass of other
trees, reminding me of the forests of the main Amazons. We rowed
for five or six miles, generally in a south-easterly direction,
although the river had many abrupt bends, and stopped for the night
at a settler&rsquo;s house, situated on a high bank, accessible
only by a flight of rude wooden steps fixed in the clayey slope.
The owners were two brothers, half-breeds, who, with their
families, shared the large roomy dwelling; one of them was a
blacksmith, and we found him working with two Indian lads at his
forge in an open shed under the shade of mango trees. They were the
sons of a Portuguese immigrant who had settled here forty years
previously, and married a Munduruc&uacute; woman. He must have been
a far more industrious man than the majority of his countrymen who
emigrate to Brazil nowadays, for there were signs of former
extensive cultivation at the back of the house in groves of orange,
lemon, and coffee trees, and a large plantation of cacao occupied
the lower grounds.</p>

<p>The next morning one of the brothers brought me a beautiful
opossum, which had been caught in the fowl-house a little before
sunrise. It was not so large as a rat, and had soft brown fur,
paler beneath and on the face, with a black stripe on each cheek.
This made the third species of marsupial rat I had so far obtained:
but the number of these animals is very considerable in Brazil,
where they take the place of the shrews of Europe; shrew mice and,
indeed, the whole of the insectivorous order of mammals, being
entirely absent from Tropical America. One kind of these rat-like
opossums is aquatic, and has webbed feet. The terrestrial species
are nocturnal in their habits, sleeping during the day in hollow
trees, and coming forth at night to prey on birds in their roosting
places. It is very difficult to rear poultry in this country on
account of these small opossums, scarcely a night passing, in some
parts, in which the fowls are not attacked by them.</p>

<p><i>August 5th.</i>&mdash;The river reminds me of some parts of
the Jabur&uacute; channel, being hemmed in by two walls of forest
rising to the height of at least a hundred feet, and the outlines
of the trees being concealed throughout by a dense curtain of leafy
creepers. The impression of vegetable profusion and overwhelming
luxuriance increases at every step. The deep and narrow valley of
the Cupar&iacute; has a moister climate than the banks of the
Tapajos. We have now frequent showers, whereas we left everything
parched up by the sun at Aveyros.</p>

<p>After leaving the last sitio we advanced about eight miles, and
then stopped at the house of Senhor Antonio Malagueita, a mameluco
settler, whom we had been recommended to visit. His house and
outbuildings were extensive, the grounds well weeded, and the whole
wore an air of comfort and well-being which is very uncommon in
this country. A bank of indurated white clay sloped gently up from
the tree-shaded port to the house, and beds of kitchen-herbs
extended on each side, with (rare sight!) rose and jasmine trees in
full bloom. Senhor Antonio, a rather tall middle-aged man, with a
countenance beaming with good nature, came down to the port as soon
as we anchored. I was quite a stranger to him, but he had heard of
my coming, and seemed to have made preparations. I never met with a
heartier welcome. On entering the house, the wife, who had more of
the Indian tint and features than her husband, was equally warm and
frank in her greeting. Senhor Antonio had spent his younger days at
Par&aacute;, and had acquired a profound respect for Englishmen. I
stayed here two days. My host accompanied me in my excursions; in
fact, his attentions, with those of his wife, and the host of
relatives of all degrees who constituted his household, were quite
troublesome, as they left me not a moment&rsquo;s privacy from
morning till night.</p>

<p>We had, together, several long and successful rambles along a
narrow pathway which extended several miles into the forest. I here
met with a new insect pest, one which the natives may be thankful
is not spread more widely over the country: it was a large brown
fly of the Tabanid&aelig; family (genus Pangonia), with a proboscis
half an inch long and sharper than the finest needle. It settled on
our backs by twos and threes at a time, and pricked us through our
thick cotton shirts, making us start and cry out with the sudden
pain. I secured a dozen or two as specimens. As an instance of the
extremely confined ranges of certain species, it may be mentioned
that I did not find this insect in any other part of the country
except along half a mile or so of this gloomy forest road.</p>

<p>We were amused at the excessive and almost absurd tameness of a
fine Mutum or Curassow turkey, that ran about the house. It was a
large glossy-black species (the Mitu tuberosa), having an orange-
coloured beak, surmounted by a bean-shaped excrescence of the same
hue. It seemed to consider itself as one of the family: attended
all the meals, passing from one person to another round the mat to
be fed, and rubbing the sides of its head in a coaxing way against
their cheeks or shoulders. At night it went to roost on a chest in
a sleeping-room beside the hammock of one of the little girls to
whom it seemed particularly attached, regularly following her
wherever she went about the grounds. I found this kind of Curassow
bird was very common in the forest of the Cupar&iacute;; but it is
rare on the Upper Amazons, where an allied species, which has a
round instead of a bean-shaped waxen excrescence on the beak (Crax
globicera), is the prevailing kind. These birds in their natural
state never descend from the tops of the loftiest trees, where they
live in small flocks and build their nests. The Mitu tuberosa lays
two rough-shelled, white eggs; it is fully as large a bird as the
common turkey, but the flesh when cooked is drier and not so well
flavoured. It is difficult to find the reason why these superb
birds have not been reduced to domestication by the Indians, seeing
that they so readily become tame. The obstacle offered by their not
breeding in confinement, which is probably owing to their arboreal
habits, might perhaps be overcome by repeated experiment; but for
this the Indians probably had not sufficient patience or
intelligence. The reason cannot lie in their insensibility to the
value of such birds, for the common turkey, which has been
introduced into the country, is much prized by them.</p>

<p>We had an unwelcome visitor whilst at anchor in the port of
Antonio Malagueita. I was awakened a little after midnight, as I
lay in my little cabin, by a heavy blow struck at the sides of the
canoe close to my head, which was succeeded by the sound of a
weighty body plunging into the water. I got up; but all was again
quiet, except the cackle of fowls in our hen-coop, which hung over
the side of the vessel about three feet from the cabin door. I
could find no explanation of the circumstance, and, my men being
all ashore, I turned in again and slept until morning. I then found
my poultry loose about the canoe, and a large rent in the bottom of
the hen-coop, which was about two feet from the surface of the
water: a couple of fowls were missing. Senhor Antonio said the
depredator was a Sucuruj&uacute; (the Indian name for the Anaconda,
or great water serpent&mdash;Eunectes murinus), which had for
months past been haunting this part of the river, and had carried
off many ducks and fowls from the ports of various houses. I was
inclined to doubt the fact of a serpent striking at its prey from
the water, and thought an alligator more likely to be the culprit,
although we had not yet met with alligators in the river. Some days
afterwards, the young men belonging to the different sitios agreed
together to go in search of the serpent. They began in a systematic
manner, forming two parties, each embarked in three or four canoes,
and starting from points several miles apart, whence they gradually
approximated, searching all the little inlets on both sides the
river. The reptile was found at last, sunning itself on a log at
the mouth of a muddy rivulet, and despatched with harpoons. I saw
it the day after it was killed; it was not a very large specimen,
measuring only eighteen feet nine inches in length, and sixteen
inches in circumference at the widest part of the body. I measured
skins of the Anaconda afterwards, twenty-one feet in length and two
feet in girth. The reptile has a most hideous appearance, owing to
its being very broad in the middle and tapering abruptly at both
ends. It is very abundant in some parts of the country; nowhere
more so than in the Lago Grande, near Santarem, where it is often
seen coiled up in the corners of farm-yards, and is detested for
its habit of carrying off poultry, young calves, or whatever animal
it can get within reach of.</p>

<p>At Ega, a large Anaconda was once near making a meal of a young
lad about ten years of age, belonging to one of my neighbours. The
father and his son went, as was their custom, a few miles up the
Teff&eacute; to gather wild fruit, landing on a sloping sandy
shore, where the boy was left to mind the canoe whilst the man
entered the forest. The beaches of the Teff&eacute; form groves of
wild guava and myrtle trees, and during most months of the year are
partly overflown by the river. Whilst the boy was playing in the
water under the shade of these trees, a huge reptile of this
species stealthily wound its coils around him, unperceived until it
was too late to escape. His cries brought the father quickly to the
rescue, who rushed forward, and seizing the Anaconda boldly by the
head, tore his jaws asunder. There appears to be no doubt that this
formidable serpent grows to an enormous bulk, and lives to a great
age, for I heard of specimens having been killed which measured
forty-two feet in length, or double the size of the largest I had
an opportunity to examine. The natives of the Amazons country
universally believe in the existence of a monster water-serpent,
said to be many score fathoms in length and which appears
successively in different parts of the river. They call it the Mai
d&rsquo;agoa&mdash;the mother, or spirit, of the water. This fable,
which was doubtless suggested by the occasional appearance of
Sucurujus of unusually large size, takes a great variety of forms,
and the wild legends form the subject of conversation amongst old
and young, over the wood fires in lonely settlements.</p>

<p><i>August 6th and 7th.</i>&mdash;On leaving the sitio of Antonio
Malagueita we continued our way along the windings of the river,
generally in a south-east and south-south-east direction, but
sometimes due north, for about fifteen miles, when we stopped at
the house of one Paulo Christo, a mameluco whose acquaintance I had
made at Aveyros. Here we spent the night and part of the next day,
doing in the morning a good five hours&rsquo; work in the forest,
accompanied by the owner of the place. In the afternoon of the 7th,
we were again under way; the river makes a bend to the
east-north-east for a short distance above Paulo Christo&rsquo;s
establishment, and then turns abruptly to the south-west, running
from that direction about four miles. The hilly country of the
interior then commences, the first token of it being a
magnificently-wooded bluff, rising nearly straight from the water
to a height of about 250 feet. The breadth of the stream hereabout
was not more than sixty yards, and the forest assumed a new
appearance from the abundance of the Urucuri palm, a species which
has a noble crown of broad fronds with symmetrical rigid
leaflets.</p>

<p>We reached, in the evening, the house of the last civilised
settler on the river, Senhor Joao (John) Arac&uacute;, a wiry,
active fellow and capital hunter, whom I wished to make a friend of
and persuade to accompany me to the Munduruc&uacute; village and
the falls of the Cupar&iacute;, some forty miles further up the
river.</p>

<p>I stayed at the sitio of John Arac&uacute; until the 19th, and
again, in descending, spent fourteen days at the same place. The
situation was most favourable for collecting the natural products
of the district. The forest was not crowded with underwood, and
pathways led through it for many miles and in various directions. I
could make no use here of our two men as hunters, so, to keep them
employed whilst Jos&eacute; and I worked daily in the woods, I set
them to make a montaria under John Arac&uacute;&rsquo;s directions.
The first day a suitable tree was found for the shell of the boat,
of the kind called Ita&uuml;ba amarello, the yellow variety of the
stonewood. They felled it, and shaped out of the trunk a log
nineteen feet in length; this they dragged from the forest, with
the help of my host&rsquo;s men, over a road they had previously
made with cylindrical pieces of wood acting as rollers. The
distance was about half a mile, and the ropes used for drawing the
heavy load were tough lianas cut from the surrounding trees. This
part of the work occupied about a week: the log had then to be
hollowed out, which was done with strong chisels through a slit
made down the whole length. The heavy portion of the task being
then completed, nothing remained but to widen the opening, fit two
planks for the sides and the same number of semicircular boards for
the ends, make the benches, and caulk the seams.</p>

<p>The expanding of the log thus hollowed out is a critical
operation, and not always successful, many a good shell being
spoiled from splitting or expanding irregularly. It is first reared
on tressels, with the slit downwards, over a large fire, which is
kept up for seven or eight hours, the process requiring unremitting
attention to avoid cracks and make the plank bend with the proper
dip at the two ends. Wooden straddlers, made by cleaving pieces of
tough elastic wood and fixing them with wedges, are inserted into
the opening, their compass being altered gradually as the work goes
on, but in different degrees according to the part of the boat
operated upon. Our casca turned out a good one: it took a long time
to cool, and was kept in shape whilst it did so by means of wooden
cross-pieces. When the boat was finished, it was launched with
great merriment by the men, who hoisted coloured handkerchiefs for
flags, and paddled it up and down the stream to try its
capabilities. My people had suffered as much inconvenience from the
want of a montaria as myself, so this was a day of rejoicing to all
of us.</p>

<p>I was very successful at this place with regard to the objects
of my journey. About twenty new species of fishes and a
considerable number of small reptiles were added to my collection;
but very few birds were met with worth preserving. A great number
of the most conspicuous insects of the locality were new to me, and
turned out to be species peculiar to this part of the Amazons
valley. The most interesting acquisition was a large and handsome
monkey, of a species I had not before met with&mdash;the
white-whiskered Coait&aacute;, or spider-monkey (Ateles
marginatus). I saw a pair one day in the forest moving slowly along
the branches of a lofty tree, and shot one of them; the next day
John Aracu brought down another, possibly the companion. The
species is of about the same size as the common black kind, of
which I have given an account in a former chapter, and has a
similar lean body, with limbs clothed with coarse black hair; but
it differs in having the whiskers and a triangular patch on the
crown of the head of a white colour. I thought the meat the best
flavoured I had ever tasted. It resembled beef, but had a richer
and sweeter taste. During the time of our stay in this part of the
Cupar&iacute;, we could get scarcely anything but fish to eat, and
as this diet disagreed with me, three successive days of it
reducing me to a state of great weakness, I was obliged to make the
most of our Coait&aacute; meat. We smoke-dried the joints instead
of salting them, placing them for several hours upon a framework of
sticks arranged over a fire, a plan adopted by the natives to
preserve fish when they have no salt, and which they call
&ldquo;muquiar.&rdquo; Meat putrefies in this climate in less than
twenty-four hours, and salting is of no use, unless the pieces are
cut in thin slices and dried immediately in the sun. My monkeys
lasted me about a fortnight, the last joint being an arm with the
clenched fist, which I used with great economy, hanging it in the
intervals, between my frugal meals, on a nail in the cabin. Nothing
but the hardest necessity could have driven me so near to
cannibalism as this, but we had the greatest difficulty in
obtaining here a sufficient supply of animal food. About every
three days the work on the montaria had to be suspended, and all
hands turned out for the day to hunt and fish, in which they were
often unsuccessful, for although there was plenty of game in the
forest, it was too widely scattered to be available. Ricardo, and
Alberto occasionally brought in a tortoise or ant-eater, which
served us for one day&rsquo;s consumption. We made acquaintance
here with many strange dishes, amongst them Iguana eggs; these are
of oblong form, about an inch in length, and covered with a
flexible shell. The lizard lays about two score of them in the
hollows of trees. They have an oily taste; the men ate them raw,
beaten up with farinha, mixing a pinch of salt in the mess; I could
only do with them when mixed with Tucup&iacute; sauce, of which we
had a large jar full always ready to temper unsavoury morsels.</p>

<p>One day as I was entomologising alone and unarmed, in a dry
Ygap&oacute;, where the trees were rather wide apart and the ground
coated to the depth of eight or ten inches with dead leaves, I was
near coming into collision with a boa constrictor. I had just
entered a little thicket to capture an insect, and whilst pinning
it was rather startled by a rushing noise in the vicinity. I looked
up to the sky, thinking a squall was coming on, but not a breath of
wind stirred in the tree-tops. On stepping out of the bushes I met
face to face a huge serpent coming down a slope, making the dry
twigs crack and fly with his weight as he moved over them. I had
very frequently met with a smaller boa, the Cutim-boia, in a
similar way, and knew from the habits of the family that there was
no danger, so I stood my ground. On seeing me the reptile suddenly
turned and glided at an accelerated pace down the path. Wishing to
take a note of his probable size and the colours and markings of
his skin, I set off after him; but he increased his speed, and I
was unable to get near enough for the purpose. There was very
little of the serpentine movement in his course. The rapidly moving
and shining body looked like a stream of brown liquid flowing over
the thick bed of fallen leaves, rather than a serpent with skin of
varied colours. He descended towards the lower and moister parts of
the Ygap&oacute;. The huge trunk of an uprooted tree here lay
across the road; this he glided over in his undeviating course and
soon after penetrated a dense swampy thicket, where of course I did
not choose to follow him.</p>

<p>I suffered terribly from heat and mosquitoes as the river sank
with the increasing dryness of the season, although I made an
awning of the sails to work under, and slept at night in the open
air with my hammock slung between the masts. But there was no rest
in any part; the canoe descended deeper and deeper into the gulley
through which the river flows between high clayey banks; as the
water subsided, and with the glowing sun overhead we felt at midday
as if in a furnace. I could bear scarcely any clothes in the
daytime between eleven in the morning and five in the afternoon,
wearing nothing but loose and thin cotton trousers and a light
straw hat, and could not be accommodated in John Aracu&rsquo;s
house, as it was a small one and full of noisy children. One night
we had a terrific storm. The heat in the afternoon had been greater
than ever, and at sunset the sky had a brassy glare, the black
patches of cloud which floated in it being lighted up now and then
by flashes of sheet lightning. The mosquitoes at night were more
than usually troublesome, and I had just sunk exhausted into a doze
towards the early hours of morning when the storm began; a complete
deluge of rain, with incessant lightning and rattling explosions of
thunder. It lasted for eight hours; the grey dawn opening amidst
the crash of the tempest. The rain trickled through the seams of
the cabin roof on to my collections, the late hot weather having
warped the boards, and it gave me immense trouble to secure them in
the midst of the confusion. Altogether I had a bad night of it; but
what with storms, heat, mosquitoes, hunger, and, towards the last,
ill health, I seldom had a good night&rsquo;s rest on the
Cupar&iacute;.</p>

<p>A small creek traversed the forest behind John Aracu&rsquo;s
house, and entered the river a few yards from our anchoring place;
I used to cross it twice a day, on going and returning from my
hunting ground. One day early in September, I noticed that the
water was two or three inches higher in the afternoon than it had
been in the morning. This phenomenon was repeated the next day, and
in fact daily, until the creek became dry with the continued
subsidence of the Cupar&iacute;, the time of rising shifting a
little from day to day. I pointed out the circumstance to John
Arac&uacute;, who had not noticed it before (it was only his second
year of residence in the locality), but agreed with me that it must
be the &ldquo;mar&eacute;&rdquo;; yes, the tide! the throb of the
great oceanic pulse felt in this remote corner, 530 miles distant
from the place where it first strikes the body of fresh water at
the mouth of the Amazons. I hesitated at first at this conclusion,
but in reflecting that the tide was known to be perceptible at
Obydos, more than 400 miles from the sea, that at high water in the
dry season a large flood from the Amazons enters the mouth of the
Tapajos, and that there is but a very small difference of level
between that point and the Cupar&iacute;, a fact shown by the
absence of current in the dry season. I could have no doubt that
this conclusion was a correct one.</p>

<p>The fact of the tide being felt 530 miles up the Amazons,
passing from the main stream to one of its affluents 380 miles from
its mouth, and thence to a branch in the third degree, is a proof
of the extreme flatness of the land which forms the lower part of
the Amazonian valley. This uniformity of level is shown also in the
broad lake-like expanses of water formed near their mouths by the
principal affluents which cross the valley to join the main
river.</p>

<p><i>August 21st.</i>&mdash;John Arac&uacute; consented to
accompany me to the falls with one of his men to hunt and fish for
me. One of my objects was to obtain specimens of the hyacinthine
macaw, whose range commences on all the branch rivers of the
Amazons which flow from the south through the interior of Brazil,
with the first cataracts. We started on the 19th; our direction on
that day being generally southwest. On the 20th, our course was
southerly and southeasterly. This morning (August 21st) we arrived
at the Indian settlement, the first house of which lies about
thirty-one miles above the sitio of John Arac&uacute;. The river at
this place is from sixty to seventy yards wide, and runs in a
zigzag course between steep clayey banks, twenty to fifty feet in
height. The houses of the Munduruc&uacute;s, to the number of about
thirty, are scattered along the banks for a distance of six or
seven miles. The owners appear to have chosen all the most
picturesque sites&mdash;tracts of level ground at the foot of
wooded heights, or little havens with bits of white sandy
beach&mdash;as if they had an appreciation of natural beauty. Most
of the dwellings are conical huts, with walls of framework filled
in with mud and thatched with palm leaves, the broad eaves reaching
halfway to the ground. Some are quadrangular, and do not differ in
structure from those of the semi-civilised settlers in other parts;
others are open sheds or ranchos. They seem generally to contain
not more than one or two families each.</p>

<p>At the first house, we learnt that all the fighting men had this
morning returned from a two days&rsquo; pursuit of a wandering
horde of savages of the Par&aacute;rau&aacute;te tribe, who had
strayed this way from the interior lands and robbed the
plantations. A little further on we came to the house of the
Tusha&uacute;a, or chief, situated on the top of a high bank, which
we had to ascend by wooden steps. There were four other houses in
the neighbourhood, all filled with people. A fine old fellow, with
face, shoulders, and breast tattooed all over in a cross-bar
pattern, was the first strange object that caught my eye. Most of
the men lay lounging or sleeping in their hammocks. The women were
employed in an adjoining shed making farinha, many of them being
quite naked, and rushing off to the huts to slip on their
petticoats when they caught sight of us. Our entrance aroused the
Tusha&uacute;a from a nap; after rubbing his eyes he came forward
and bade us welcome with the most formal politeness, and in very
good Portuguese. He was a tall, broad-shouldered, well-made man,
apparently about thirty years of age, with handsome regular
features, not tattooed, and a quiet good-humoured expression of
countenance. He had been several times to Santarem and once to
Par&aacute;, learning the Portuguese language during these
journeys. He was dressed in shirt and trousers made of blue-checked
cotton cloth, and there was not the slightest trace of the savage
in his appearance or demeanour. I was told that he had come into
the chieftainship by inheritance, and that the Cupar&iacute; horde
of Munduruc&uacute;s, over which his fathers had ruled before him,
was formerly much more numerous, furnishing 300 bows in time of
war. They could now scarcely muster forty; but the horde has no
longer a close political connection with the main body of the
tribe, which inhabits the banks of the Tapajos, six days&rsquo;
journey from the Cupar&iacute; settlement.</p>

<p>I spent the remainder of the day here, sending Arac&uacute; and
the men to fish, whilst I amused myself with the Tusha&uacute;a and
his people. A few words served to explain my errand on the river;
he comprehended at once why white men should admire and travel to
collect the beautiful birds and animals of his country, and neither
he nor his people spoke a single word about trading, or gave us any
trouble by coveting the things we had brought. He related to me the
events of the preceding three days. The Par&aacute;rau&aacute;tes
were a tribe of intractable savages, with whom the
Munduruc&uacute;s have been always at war. They had no fixed abode,
and of course made no plantations, but passed their lives like the
wild beasts, roaming through the forest, guided by the sun;
wherever they found themselves at night-time there they slept,
slinging their bast hammocks, which are carried by the women, to
the trees. They cross the streams which lie in their course in bark
canoes, which they make on reaching the water, and cast away after
landing on the opposite side. The tribe is very numerous, but the
different hordes obey only their own chieftains. The
Munduruc&uacute;s of the upper Tapajos have an expedition on foot
against them at the present time, and the Tusha&uacute;a supposed
that the horde which had just been chased from his maloca were
fugitives from that direction. There were about a hundred of
them&mdash;including men, women, and children. Before they were
discovered, the hungry savages had uprooted all the macasheira,
sweet potatoes, and sugar cane, which the industrious
Munduruc&uacute;s had planted for the season, on the east side of
the river. As soon as they were seen they made off, but the
Tasha&uacute;a quickly got together all the young men of the
settlement, about thirty in number, who armed themselves with guns,
bows and arrows, and javelins, and started in pursuit. They tracked
them, as before related, for two days through the forest, but lost
their traces on the further bank of the Cuparitinga, a branch
stream flowing from the northeast. The pursuers thought, at one
time, they were close upon them, having found the inextinguished
fire of their last encampment. The footmarks of the chief could be
distinguished from the rest by their great size and the length of
the stride. A small necklace made of scarlet beans was the only
trophy of the expedition, and this the Tasha&uacute;a gave to
me.</p>

<p>I saw very little of the other male Indians, as they were asleep
in their huts all the afternoon. There were two other tattooed men
lying under an open shed, besides the old man already mentioned.
One of them presented a strange appearance, having a semicircular
black patch in the middle of his face, covering the bottom of the
nose and mouth, crossed lines on his back and breast, and stripes
down his arms and legs. It is singular that the graceful curved
patterns used by the South Sea Islanders are quite unknown amongst
the Brazilian red men; they being all tattooed either in simple
lines or patches. The nearest approach to elegance of design which
I saw was amongst the Tucunas of the Upper Amazons, some of whom
have a scroll-like mark on each cheek, proceeding from the corner
of the mouth. The taste, as far as form is concerned, of the
American Indian, would seem to be far less refined than that of the
Tahitian and New Zealander.</p>

<p>To amuse the Tasha&uacute;a, I fetched from the canoe the two
volumes of Knight&rsquo;s Pictorial Museum of Animated Nature. The
engravings quite took his fancy, and he called his wives, of whom,
as I afterwards learned from Arac&uacute;, he had three or four, to
look at them; one of them was a handsome girl, decorated with
necklace and bracelets of blue beads. In a short time, others left
their work, and I then had a crowd of women and children around me,
who all displayed unusual curiosity for Indians. It was no light
task to go through the whole of the illustrations, but they would
not allow me to miss a page, making me turn back when I tried to
skip. The pictures of the elephant, camels, orang-otangs, and
tigers, seemed most to astonish them; but they were interested in
almost everything, down even to the shells and insects. They
recognised the portraits of the most striking birds and mammals
which are found in their own country; the jaguar, howling monkeys,
parrots, trogons, and toucans. The elephant was settled to be a
large kind of Tapir; but they made but few remarks, and those in
the Munduruc&uacute; language, of which I understood only two or
three words. Their way of expressing surprise was a clicking sound
made with the teeth, similar to the one we ourselves use, or a
subdued exclamation, Hm! hm! Before I finished, from fifty to sixty
had assembled; there was no pushing or rudeness, the grown-up women
letting the young girls and children stand before them, and all
behaved in the most quiet and orderly manner possible.</p>

<p>The Munduruc&uacute;s are perhaps the most numerous and
formidable tribe of Indians now surviving in the Amazons region.
They inhabit the shores of the Tapajos (chiefly the right bank),
from 3&deg; to 7&deg; south latitude, and the interior of the
country between that part of the river and the Madeira. On the
Tapajos alone they can muster, I was told, 2000 fighting men; the
total population of the tribe may be about 20,000. They were not
heard of until about ninety years ago, when they made war on the
Portuguese settlements, their hosts crossing the interior of the
country eastward of the Tapajos, and attacking the establishments
of the whites in the province of Maranham. The Portuguese made
peace with them in the beginning of the present century, the event
being brought about by the common cause of quarrel entertained by
the two peoples against the hated M&uacute;ras. They have ever
since been firm friends of the whites. It is remarkable how
faithfully this friendly feeling has been handed down amongst the
Munduruc&uacute;s, and spread to the remotest of the scattered
hordes. Wherever a white man meets a family, or even an individual
of the tribe, he is almost sure to be reminded of this alliance.
They are the most warlike of the Brazilian tribes, and are
considered also the most settled and industrious; they are not,
however, superior in this latter respect to the Jur&iacute;s and
Pass&eacute;s on the Upper Amazons, or the Uap&eacute;s Indians
near the headwaters of the Rio Negro. They make very large
plantations of mandioca, and sell the surplus produce, which
amounts to, on the Tapajos, from 3000 to 5000 baskets (60 lbs.
each) annually, to traders who ascend the river from Santarem
between the months of August and January. They also gather large
quantities of sarsaparilla, India-rubber, and Tonka beans, in the
forests. The traders, on their arrival at the Campinas (the
scantily wooded region inhabited by the main body of
Munduruc&uacute;s beyond the cataracts) have first to distribute
their wares&mdash;cheap cotton cloths, iron hatchets, cutlery,
small wares, and casha&ccedil;a&mdash;amongst the minor chiefs, and
then wait three or four months for repayment in produce.</p>

<p>A rapid change is taking place in the habits of these Indians
through frequent intercourse with the whites, and those who dwell
on the banks of the Tapajos now seldom tattoo their children. The
principal Tasha&uacute;a of the whole tribe or nation, named
Joaquim, was rewarded with a commission in the Brazilian army, in
acknowledgment of the assistance he gave to the legal authorities
during the rebellion of 1835-6. It would be a misnomer to call the
Munduruc&uacute;s of the Cupar&iacute; and many parts of the
Tapajos savages; their regular mode of life, agricultural habits,
loyalty to their chiefs, fidelity to treaties, and gentleness of
demeanour, give them a right to a better title. Yet they show no
aptitude for the civilised life of towns, and, like the rest of the
Brazilian tribes, seem incapable of any further advance in culture.
In their former wars they exterminated two of the neighbouring
peoples, the J&uacute;mas and the Jacar&eacute;s, and make now an
annual expedition against the Par&aacute;rau&aacute;tes, and one or
two other similar wild tribes who inhabit the interior of the land.
Additionally they are sometimes driven by hunger towards the banks
of the great rivers to rob the plantations of the agricultural
Indians. These campaigns begin in July, and last throughout the dry
months; the women generally accompanying the warriors to carry
their arrows and javelins. They had the diabolical custom, in
former days, of cutting off the heads of their slain enemies, and
preserving them as trophies around their houses. I believe this,
together with other savage practices, has been relinquished in
those parts where they have had long intercourse with the
Brazilians, for I could neither see nor hear anything of these
preserved heads. They used to sever the head with knives made of
broad bamboo, and then, after taking out the brain and fleshy
parts, soak it in bitter vegetable oil (andiroba), and expose it
for several days over the smoke of a fire or in the sun. In the
tract of country between the Tapajos and the Madeira, a deadly war
has been for many years carried on between the Munduruc&uacute;s
and the Ar&aacute;ras. I was told by a Frenchman at Santarem, who
had visited that part, that all the settlements there have a
military organisation. A separate shed is built outside each
village, where the fighting men sleep at night, sentinels being
stationed to give the alarm with blasts of the Tur&eacute; on the
approach of the Ar&aacute;ras, who choose the night for their
onslaughts.</p>

<p>Each horde of Munduruc&uacute;s has its paj&eacute; or medicine
man, who is the priest and doctor; he fixes upon the time most
propitious for attacking the enemy; exorcises evil spirits, and
professes to cure the sick. All illness whose origin is not very
apparent is supposed to be caused by a worm in the part affected.
This the paj&eacute; pretends to extract; he blows on the seat of
pain the smoke from a large cigar, made with an air of great
mystery by rolling tobacco in folds of Tauar&iacute;, and then
sucks the place, drawing from his mouth, when he has finished, what
he pretends to be the worm. It is a piece of very clumsy conjuring.
One of these paj&eacute;s was sent for by a woman in John
Aracu&rsquo;s family, to operate on a child who suffered much from
pains in the head. Senhor John contrived to get possession of the
supposed worm after the trick was performed in our presence, and it
turned out to be a long white air-root of some plant. The
paj&eacute; was with difficulty persuaded to operate whilst Senhor
John and I were present. I cannot help thinking that he, as well as
all others of the same profession, are conscious impostors, handing
down the shallow secret of their divinations and tricks from
generation to generation. The institution seems to be common to all
tribes of Indians, and to be held to more tenaciously than any
other.</p>

<p>I bought of the Tasha&uacute;a two beautiful feather sceptres,
with their bamboo cases. These are of cylindrical shape, about
three feet in length and three inches in diameter, and are made by
gluing with wax the fine white and yellow feathers from the breast
of the toucan on stout rods, the tops being ornamented with long
plumes from the tails of parrots, trogons, and other birds. The
Munduruc&uacute;s are considered to be the most expert workers in
feathers of all the South American tribes. It is very difficult,
however, to get them to part with the articles, as they seem to
have a sort of superstitious regard for them. They manufacture
head-dresses, sashes, and tunics, besides sceptres; the feathers
being assorted with a good eye to the proper contrast of colours,
and the quills worked into strong cotton webs, woven with knitting
sticks in the required shape. The dresses are worn only during
their festivals, which are celebrated, not at stated times, but
whenever the Tasha&uacute;a thinks fit. Dancing, singing, sports,
and drinking, appear to be the sole objects of these occasional
holidays. When a day is fixed upon, the women prepare a great
quantity of tarob&aacute;, and the monotonous jingle is kept up,
with little intermission, night and day, until the stimulating
beverage is finished.</p>

<p>We left the Tasha&uacute;a&rsquo;s house early the next morning.
The impression made upon me by the glimpse of Indian life in its
natural state obtained here, and at another cluster of houses
visited higher up, was a pleasant one, notwithstanding the
disagreeable incident of the Par&aacute;rau&aacute;te visit. The
Indians are here seen to the best advantage; having relinquished
many of their most barbarous practices, without being corrupted by
too close contact with the inferior whites and half-breeds of the
civilised settlements. The manners are simpler, the demeanour more
gentle, cheerful, and frank, than amongst the Indians who live near
the towns. I could not help contrasting their well-fed condition,
and the signs of orderly, industrious habits, with the poverty and
laziness of the semi-civilised people of Altar do Chao. I do not
think that the introduction of liquors has been the cause of much
harm to the Brazilian Indian. He has his drinking bout now and
then, like the common working people of other countries. It was his
habit in his original state, before Europeans visited his country,
but he is always ashamed of it afterwards, and remains sober during
the pretty long intervals. The harsh, slave-driving practices of
the Portuguese and their descendants have been the greatest curses
to the Indians; the Munduruc&uacute;s of the Cupar&iacute;,
however, have been now for many years protected against
ill-treatment. This is one of the good services rendered by the
missionaries, who take care that the Brazilian laws in favour of
the aborigines shall be respected by the brutal and unprincipled
traders who go amongst them. I think no Indians could be in a
happier position than these simple, peaceful, and friendly people
on the banks of the Cupar&iacute;. The members of each family live
together, and seem to be much attached to each other; and the
authority of the chief is exercised in the mildest manner.
Perpetual summer reigns around them; the land is of the highest
fertility, and a moderate amount of light work produces them all
the necessaries of their simple life. It is difficult to get at
their notions on subjects that require a little abstract thought;
but the mind of the Indian is in a very primitive condition. I
believe he thinks of nothing except the matters that immediately
concern his daily material wants. There is an almost total absence
of curiosity in his mental disposition, consequently, he troubles
himself very little concerning the causes of the natural phenomena
around him. He has no idea of a Supreme Being; but, at the same
time, he is free from revolting superstitions&mdash;his religious
notions going no farther than the belief in an evil spirit,
regarded merely as a kind of hobgoblin, who is at the bottom of all
his little failures, troubles in fishing, hunting, and so forth.
With so little mental activity, and with feelings and passions slow
of excitement, the life of these people is naturally monotonous and
dull, and their virtues are, properly speaking, only negative; but
the picture of harmless, homely contentment they exhibit is very
pleasing, compared with the state of savage races in many other
parts of the world.</p>

<p>The men awoke me at four o&rsquo;clock with the sound of their
oars on leaving the port of the Tasha&uacute;a. I was surprised to
find a dense fog veiling all surrounding objects, and the air quite
cold. The lofty wall of forest, with the beautiful crowns of Assai
palms standing out from it on their slender, arching stems, looked
dim and strange through the misty curtain. The sudden change a
little after sunrise had quite a magical effect, for the mist rose
up like the gauze veil before the transformation scene at a
pantomime, and showed the glorious foliage in the bright glow of
morning, glittering with dew drops. We arrived at the falls about
ten o&rsquo;clock. The river here is not more than forty yards
broad, and falls over a low ledge of rock stretching in a nearly
straight line across.</p>

<p>We had now arrived at the end of the navigation for large
vessels&mdash;a distance from the mouth of the river, according to
our rough calculation, of a little over seventy miles. I found it
the better course now to send Jos&eacute; and one of the men
forward in the montaria with John Arac&uacute;, and remain myself
with the cuberta and our other man to collect in the neighbouring
forest. We stayed here four days, one of the boats returning each
evening from the upper river with the produce of the day&rsquo;s
chase of my huntsmen. I obtained six good specimens of the
hyacinthine macaw, besides a number of smaller birds, a species new
to me of Guar&iacute;ba, or howling monkey, and two large lizards.
The Guar&iacute;ba was an old male, with the hair much worn from
his rump and breast, and his body disfigured with large tumours
made by the grubs of a gad-fly (&OElig;strus). The back and tail
were of a ruddy-brown colour, the limbs, and underside of the body,
black. The men ascended to the second falls, which form a cataract
several feet in height, about fifteen miles beyond our anchorage.
The macaws were found feeding in small flocks on the fruit of the
Tucum&aacute; palm (Astryocaryum Tucum&aacute;), the excessively
hard nut of which is crushed into pulp by the powerful beak of the
bird. I found the craws of all the specimens filled with the sour
paste to which the stone-like fruit had been reduced. Each bird
took me three hours to skin, and I was occupied with these and my
other specimens every evening until midnight, after my own
laborious day&rsquo;s hunt; working on the roof of my cabin by the
light of a lamp.</p>

<p>The place where the cuberta was anchored formed a little rocky
haven, with a sandy beach sloping to the forest, within which were
the ruins of an Indian Maloca, and a large weed-grown plantation.
The port swarmed with fishes, whose movements it was amusing to
watch in the deep, clear water. The most abundant were the
Pir&aacute;nhas. One species, which varied in length, according to
age, from two to six inches, but was recognisable by a black spot
at the root of the tail, was always the quickest to seize any
fragment of meat thrown into the water. When nothing was being
given to them, a few only were seen scattered about, their heads
all turned one way in an attitude of expectation; but as soon as
any offal fell from the canoe, the water was blackened with the
shoals that rushed instantaneously to the spot. Those who did not
succeed in securing a fragment, fought with those who had been more
successful, and many contrived to steal the coveted morsels from
their mouths. When a bee or fly passed through the air near the
water, they all simultaneously darted towards it as if roused by an
electric shock. Sometimes a larger fish approached, and then the
host of Pir&aacute;nhas took the alarm and flashed out of sight.
The population of the water varied from day to day. Once a small
shoal of a handsome black-banded fish, called by the natives
Acar&aacute; bandeira (Mesonauta insignis, of G&uuml;nther), came
gliding through at a slow pace, forming a very pretty sight. At
another time, little troops of needle-fish, eel-like animals with
excessively long and slender toothed jaws, sailed through the
field, scattering before them the hosts of smaller fry; and at the
rear of the needle-fishes, a strangely-shaped kind called
Sarap&oacute; came wriggling along, one by one, with a slow
movement. We caught with hook and line, baited with pieces of
banana, several Curimat&aacute; (Anodus Amazonum), a most delicious
fish, which, next to the Tucunare and the Pescada, is most esteemed
by the natives. The Curimat&aacute; seemed to prefer the middle of
the stream, where the waters were agitated beneath the little
cascade.</p>

"Acar&aacute; (Mesonauta insignis)."></center>

<p>The weather was now settled and dry, and the river sank
rapidly&mdash; six inches in twenty-four hours. In this remote and
solitary spot I can say that I heard for the first and almost the
only time the uproar of life at sunset, which Humboldt describes as
having witnessed towards the sources of the Orinoco, but which is
unknown on the banks of the larger rivers. The noises of animals
began just as the sun sank behind the trees after a sweltering
afternoon, leaving the sky above of the intensest shade of blue.
Two flocks of howling monkeys, one close to our canoe, the other
about a furlong distant, filled the echoing forests with their
dismal roaring. Troops of parrots, including the hyacinthine macaw
we were in search of, began then to pass over; the different styles
of cawing and screaming of the various species making a terrible
discord. Added to these noises were the songs of strange Cicadas,
one large kind perched high on the trees around our little haven
setting up a most piercing chirp; it began with the usual harsh
jarring tone of its tribe, but this gradually and rapidly became
shriller, until it ended in a long and loud note resembling the
steam-whistle of a locomotive engine. Half-a-dozen of these
wonderful performers made a considerable item in the evening
concert. I had heard the same species before at Par&aacute;, but it
was there very uncommon: we obtained one of them here for my
collection by a lucky blow with a stone. The uproar of beasts,
birds, and insects lasted but a short time: the sky quickly lost
its intense hue, and the night set in. Then began the
tree-frogs&mdash;quack-quack, drum-drum, hoo-hoo; these,
accompanied by a melancholy night-jar, kept up their monotonous
cries until very late.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig22.jpg" width="430" height="116" alt=
"Sarap&oacute; (Carapus). Needle-fish (Hemaramphus)."></center>

<p>My men encountered on the banks of the stream a Jaguar and a
black Tiger, and were very much afraid of falling in with the
Par&aacute;rau&aacute;tes, so that I could not, after their return
on the fourth day, induce them to undertake another journey. We
began our descent of the river in the evening of the 26th of
August. At night forest and river were again enveloped in mist, and
the air before sunrise was quite cold. There is a considerable
current from the falls to the house of John Arac&uacute;, and we
accomplished the distance, with its aid and by rowing, in seventeen
hours.</p>

<p><i>September 21st.</i>&mdash;At five o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon we emerged from the confined and stifling gully through
which the Cupar&iacute; flows, into the broad Tapajos, and breathed
freely again. How I enjoyed the extensive view after being so long
pent up: the mountainous coasts, the grey distance, the dark waters
tossed by a refreshing breeze! Heat, mosquitoes, insufficient and
bad food, hard work and anxiety, had brought me to a very low state
of health; and I was now anxious to make all speed back to
Santarem.</p>

<p>We touched at Aveyros, to embark some chests I had left there
and to settle accounts with Captain Antonio, and found nearly all
the people sick with fever and vomit, against which the
Padre&rsquo;s homoeopathic globules were of no avail. The Tapajos
had been pretty free from epidemics for some years past, although
it was formerly a very unhealthy river. A sickly time appeared to
be now returning; in fact, the year following my visit (1853) was
the most fatal one ever experienced in this part of the country. A
kind of putrid fever broke out, which attacked people of all races
alike. The accounts we received at Santarem were most distressing:
my Cupar&iacute; friends especially suffered very severely. John
Arac&uacute; and his family all fell victims, with the exception of
his wife; my kind friend Antonio Malagueita also died, and a great
number of people in the Munduruc&uacute; village.</p>

<p>The descent of the Tapajos in the height of the dry season,
which was now close at hand, is very hazardous on account of the
strong winds, absence of current, and shoaly water far away from
the coasts. The river towards the end of September is about thirty
feet shallower than in June; and in many places, ledges of rock are
laid bare, or covered with only a small depth of water. I had been
warned of these circumstances by my Cupar&iacute; friends, but did
not form an adequate idea of what we should have to undergo.
Canoes, in descending, only travel at night, when the terral, or
light land-breeze, blows off the eastern shore. In the day-time a
strong wind rages from down river, against which it is impossible
to contend as there is no current, and the swell raised by its
sweeping over scores of miles of shallow water is dangerous to
small vessels. The coast for the greater part of the distance
affords no shelter; there are, however, a number of little
harbours, called <i>esperas</i>, which the canoemen calculate upon,
carefully arranging each night-voyage so as to reach one of them
before the wind begins the next morning.</p>

<p>We left Aveyros in the evening of the 21st, and sailed gently
down with the soft land-breeze, keeping about a mile from the
eastern shore. It was a brilliant moonlit night, and the men worked
cheerfully at the oars when the wind was slack, the terral wafting
from the forest a pleasant perfume like that of mignonette. At
midnight we made a fire and got a cup of coffee, and at three
o&rsquo;clock in the morning reached the sitio of Ricardo&rsquo;s
father, an Indian named Andr&eacute;, where we anchored and
slept.</p>

<p><i>September 22nd.</i>&mdash;Old Andr&eacute; with his squaw
came aboard this morning. They brought three Tracaj&aacute;s, a
turtle, and a basketful of Tracaj&aacute; eggs, to exchange with me
for cotton cloth and casha&ccedil;a. Ricardo, who had been for some
time very discontented, having now satisfied his longing to see his
parents, cheerfully agreed to accompany me to Santarem. The loss of
a man at this juncture would have been very annoying, with Captain
Antonio ill at Aveyros, and not a hand to be had anywhere in the
neighbourhood; but, if we had not called at Andr&eacute;&rsquo;s
sitio, we should not have been able to have kept Ricardo from
running away at the first landing-place. He was a lively, restless
lad, and although impudent and troublesome at first, had made a
very good servant. His companion, Alberto, was of quite a different
disposition, being extremely taciturn, and going through all his
duties with the quietest regularity.</p>

<p>We left at 11 a.m., and progressed a little before the wind
began to blow from down river, when we were obliged again to cast
anchor. The terral began at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, and
we sailed with it past the long line of rock-bound coast near
Itapu&aacute;ma. At ten o&rsquo;clock a furious blast of wind came
from a cleft between the hills, catching us with the sails
close-hauled, and throwing the canoe nearly on its beam-ends, when
we were about a mile from the shore. Jos&eacute; had the presence
of mind to slacken the sheet of the mainsail, whilst I leapt
forward and lowered the sprit of the foresail, the two Indians
standing stupefied in the prow. It was what the canoe-men call a
<i>trovoada secca</i> or white squall. The river in a few minutes
became a sheet of foam; the wind ceased in about half an hour, but
the terral was over for the night, so we pulled towards the shore
to find an anchoring place.</p>

<p>We reached Tapaiuna by midnight on the 23rd, and on the morning
of the 24th arrived at the Retiro, where we met a shrewd Santarem
trader, whom I knew, Senhor Chico Honorio, who had a larger and
much better provided canoe than our own. The wind was strong from
below all day, so we remained at this place in his company. He had
his wife with him, and a number of Indians, male and female. We
slung our hammocks under the trees, and breakfasted and dined
together, our cloth being spread on the sandy beach in the shade
after killing a large quantity of fish with <i>timb&oacute;</i>, of
which we had obtained a supply at Itapu&aacute;ma. At night we were
again under way with the land breeze. The water was shoaly to a
great distance off the coast, and our canoe having the lighter
draught went ahead, our leadsman crying out the soundings to our
companion: the depth was only one fathom, half a mile from the
coast. We spent the next day (25th) at the mouth of a creek called
Pini, which is exactly opposite the village of Boim, and on the
following night advanced about twelve miles. Every point of land
had a long spit of sand stretching one or two miles towards the
middle of the river, which it was necessary to double by a wide
circuit. The terral failed us at midnight when we were near an <i>
espera</i>, called Mara&iuml;, the mouth of a shallow creek.</p>

<p><i>September 26th.</i>&mdash;I did not like the prospect of
spending the whole dreary day at Mara&iuml;, where it was
impossible to ramble ashore, the forest being utterly impervious,
and the land still partly under water. Besides, we had used up our
last stick of firewood to boil our coffee at sunrise, and could not
get a fresh supply at this place. So there being a dead calm on the
river in the morning, I gave orders at ten o&rsquo;clock to move
out of the harbour, and try with the oars to reach
Paquiat&uacute;ba, which was only five miles distant. We had
doubled the shoaly point which stretches from the mouth of the
creek, and were making way merrily across the bay, at the head of
which was the port of the little settlement, when we beheld to our
dismay, a few miles down the river, the signs of the violent day
breeze coming down upon us&mdash;a long, rapidly advancing line of
foam with the darkened water behind it. Our men strove in vain to
gain the harbour; the wind overtook us, and we cast anchor in three
fathoms, with two miles of shoaly water between us and the land on
our lee. It came with the force of a squall: the heavy billows
washing over the vessel and drenching us with the spray. I did not
expect that our anchor would hold; I gave out, however, plenty of
cable and watched the result at the prow, Jos&eacute; placing
himself at the helm, and the men standing by the jib and foresail,
so as to be ready if we dragged to attempt the passage of the
Mara&iuml; spit, which was now almost dead to leeward. Our little
bit of iron, however, held its place; the bottom being fortunately
not so sandy as in most other parts of the coast; but our weak
cable then began to cause us anxiety. We remained in this position
all day without food, for everything was tossing about in the hold;
provision-chests, baskets, kettles, and crockery. The breeze
increased in strength towards the evening, when the sun set fiery
red behind the misty hills on the western shore, and the gloom of
the scene was heightened by the strange contrasts of colour; the
inky water and the lurid gleam of the sky. Heavy seas beat now and
then against the prow of our vessel with a force that made her
shiver. If we had gone ashore in this place, all my precious
collections would have been inevitably lost; but we ourselves could
have scrambled easily to land, and re-embarked with Senhor Honorio,
who had remained behind in the Pin&iacute;, and would pass in the
course of two or three days. When night came I lay down exhausted
with watching and fatigue, and fell asleep, as my men had done
sometime before. About nine o&rsquo;clock, I was awakened by the
montaria bumping against the sides of the vessel, which had veered
suddenly round, and the full moon, previously astern, then shone
full in the cabin. The wind had abruptly ceased, giving place to
light puffs from the eastern shore, and leaving a long swell
rolling into the shoaly bay.</p>

<p>After this I resolved not to move a step beyond
Paquiat&uacute;ba without an additional man, and one who understood
the navigation of the river at this season. We reached the
landing-place at ten o&rsquo;clock, and anchored within the mouth
of the creek. In the morning I walked through the beautiful shady
alleys of the forest, which were water-paths in June when we
touched here in ascending the river to the house of Inspector
Cypriano. After an infinite deal of trouble, I succeeded in
persuading him to furnish me with another Indian. There are about
thirty families established in this place, but the able-bodied men
had been nearly all drafted off within the last few weeks by the
Government, to accompany a military expedition against runaway
negroes, settled in villages in the interior. Senhor Cypriano was a
pleasant-looking and extremely civil young Mameluco. He accompanied
us, on the night of the 28th, five miles down the river to Point
Jaguarar&iacute;, where the man lived whom he intended to send with
me. I was glad to find my new hand a steady, middle-aged and
married Indian; his name was of very good promise, Angelo Custodio
(Guardian Angel).</p>

<p>Point Jaguarar&iacute; forms at this season of the year a high
sandbank, which is prolonged as a narrow spit, stretching about
three miles towards the middle of the river. We rounded this with
great difficulty on the night of the 29th, reaching before daylight
a good shelter behind a similar sandbank at Point
Acar&aacute;tingari, a headland situated not more than five miles
in a straight line from our last anchoring place. We remained here
all day; the men beating <i>timb&oacute;</i> in a quiet pool
between the sandbank and the mainland, and obtaining a great
quantity of fish, from which I selected six species new to my
collection. We made rather better progress the two following
nights, but the terral now always blew strongly from the
north-north-east after midnight, and thus limited the hours during
which we could navigate, forcing us to seek the nearest shelter to
avoid being driven back faster than we came.</p>

<p>On the 2nd of October, we reached Point Cajet&uacute;ba and had
a pleasant day ashore. The river scenery in this neighbourhood is
of the greatest beauty. A few houses of settlers are seen at the
bottom of the broad bay of Aram&aacute;na-&iacute; at the foot of a
range of richly-timbered hills, the high beach of snow-white sand
stretching in a bold curve from point to point. The opposite shores
of the river are ten or eleven miles distant, but towards the north
is a clear horizon of water and sky. The country near Point
Cajet&uacute;ba is similar to the neighbourhood of Santarem:
namely, campos with scattered trees. We gathered a large quantity
of wild fruit: Caj&uacute;, Umir&iacute;, and
A&aacute;pir&aacute;nga. The Umir&iacute; berry (Humirium
floribundum) is a black drupe similar in appearance to the
Damascene plum, and not greatly unlike it in taste. The
A&aacute;pir&aacute;nga is a bright vermilion-coloured berry, with
a hard skin and a sweet viscid pulp enclosing the seeds. Between
the point and Altar do Chao was a long stretch of sandy beach with
moderately deep water; our men, therefore, took a rope ashore and
towed the cuberta at merry speed until we reached the village. A
long, deeply laden canoe with miners from the interior provinces
passed us here. It was manned by ten Indians, who propelled the
boat by poles; the men, five on each side, trotting one after the
other along a plank arranged for the purpose from stem to
stern.</p>

<p>It took us two nights to double Point Curur&uacute;, where, as
already mentioned, the river bends from its northerly course beyond
Altar do Chao. A confused pile of rocks, on which many a vessel
heavily laden with farinha has been wrecked, extends at the season
of low water from the foot of a high bluff far into the stream. We
were driven back on the first night (October 3rd) by a squall. The
light terral was carrying us pleasantly round the spit, when a
small black cloud which lay near the rising moon suddenly spread
over the sky to the northward; the land breeze then ceased, and
furious blasts began to blow across the river. We regained, with
great difficulty, the shelter of the point. It blew almost a
hurricane for two hours, during the whole of which time the sky
over our heads was beautifully clear and starlit. Our shelter at
first was not very secure, for the wind blew away the lashings of
our sails, and caused our anchor to drag. Angelo Custodio, however,
seized a rope which was attached to the foremast, and leapt ashore;
had he not done so, we should probably have been driven many miles
backwards up the storm-tossed river. After the cloud had passed,
the regular east wind began to blow, and our further progress was
effectually stopped for the night. The next day we all went ashore,
after securing well the canoe, and slept from eleven o&rsquo;clock
till five under the shade of trees.</p>

<p>The distance between Point Curur&uacute; and Santarem was
accomplished in three days, against the same difficulties of
contrary and furious winds, shoaly water, and rocky coasts. I was
thankful at length to be safely housed, with the whole of my
collections, made under so many privations and perils, landed
without the loss or damage of a specimen. The men, after unloading
the canoe and delivering it to its owner, came to receive their
payment. They took part in goods and part in money, and after a
good supper, on the night of the 7th October, shouldered their
bundles and set off to walk by land some eighty miles to their
homes. I was rather surprised at the good feeling exhibited by
these poor Indians at parting. Angelo Custodio said that whenever I
should wish to make another voyage up the Tapajos, he would be
always ready to serve me as pilot. Alberto was undemonstrative as
usual; but Ricardo, with whom I had had many sharp quarrels,
actually shed tears when he shook hands and bid me the final
&ldquo;adios.&rdquo;</p>
