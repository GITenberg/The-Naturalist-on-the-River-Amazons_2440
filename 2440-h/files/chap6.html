<br>
<p class="first">At the time of my first voyage up the
Amazons&mdash;namely, in 1849&mdash;nearly all communication with
the interior was by means of small sailing-vessels, owned by
traders residing in the remote towns and villages, who seldom came
to Par&aacute; themselves, but entrusted vessels and cargoes to the
care of half-breeds or Portuguese cabos. Sometimes, indeed, they
risked all in the hands of the Indian crew, making the pilot, who
was also steersman, do duty as supercargo. Now and then, Portuguese
and Brazilian merchants at Par&aacute; furnished young Portuguese
with merchandise, and dispatched them to the interior to exchange
the goods for produce amongst the scattered population. The means
of communication, in fact, with the upper parts of the Amazons had
been on the decline for some time, on account of the augmented
difficulty of obtaining hands to navigate vessels. Formerly, when
the Government wished to send any important functionary, such as a
judge or a military commandant, into the interior, they equipped a
swift-sailing galliota manned with ten or a dozen Indians. These
could travel, on the average, in one day farther than the ordinary
sailing craft could in three. Indian paddlers were now, however,
almost impossible to be obtained, and Government officers were
obliged to travel as passengers in trading-vessels. The voyage made
in this way was tedious in the extreme. When the regular east-wind
blew&mdash;the &ldquo;vento geral,&rdquo; or trade-wind of the
Amazons&mdash;sailing-vessels could get along very well; but when
this failed, they were obliged to remain, sometimes many days
together, anchored near the shore, or progress laboriously by means
of the &ldquo;espia.&rdquo; The latter mode of travelling was as
follows. The montaria, with twenty or thirty fathoms of cable, one
end of which was attached to the foremast, was sent ahead with a
couple of hands, who secured the other end of the rope to some
strong bough or tree-trunk; the crew then hauled the vessel up to
the point, after which the men in the boat re-embarked the cable,
and paddled forwards to repeat the process. In the dry season, from
August to December, when the trade-wind is strong and the currents
slack, a schooner could reach the mouth of the Rio Negro, a
thousand miles from Par&aacute;, in about forty days; but in the
wet season, from January to July, when the east-wind no longer
blows and the Amazons pours forth its full volume of water,
flooding the banks and producing a tearing current, it took three
months to travel the same distance. It was a great blessing to the
inhabitants when, in 1853, a line of steamers was established, and
this same journey could be accomplished with ease and comfort, at
all seasons, in eight days!</p>

<br>
<p>It is, perhaps, not generally known that the Portuguese, as
early as 1710, had a fair knowledge of the Amazons; but the
information gathered by their Government, from various expeditions
undertaken on a grand scale, was long withheld from the rest of the
world, through the jealous policy which ruled in their colonial
affairs. From the foundation of Par&aacute; by Caldeira, in 1615,
to the settlement of the boundary line between the Spanish and
Portuguese possessions, Peru and Brazil, in 1781-91, numbers of
these expeditions were undertaken in succession. The largest was
the one commanded by Pedro Texeira in 1637-9, who ascended the
river to Quito by way of the Napo, a distance of about 2800 miles,
with 45 canoes and 900 men, and returned to Par&aacute; without any
great misadventure by the same route. The success of this
remarkable undertaking amply proved, at that early date, the
facility of the river navigation, the practicability of the
country, and the good disposition of the aboriginal inhabitants.
The river, however, was first discovered by the Spaniards, the
mouth having been visited by Pinzon in 1500, and nearly the whole
course of the river navigated by Orellana in 1541-2. The voyage of
the latter was one of the most remarkable on record. Orellana was a
lieutenant of Gonzalo Pizarro, Governor of Quito, and accompanied
the latter in an adventurous journey which he undertook across the
easternmost chain of the Andes, down into the sweltering valley of
the Napo, in search of the land of El Dorado, or the Gilded King.
They started with 300 soldiers and 4000 Indian porters; but,
arrived on the banks of one of the tributaries of the Napo, their
followers were so greatly decreased in number by disease and
hunger, and the remainder so much weakened, that Pizarro was
obliged to despatch Orellana with fifty men, in a vessel they had
built, to the Napo, in search of provisions. It can be imagined by
those acquainted with the Amazons country how fruitless this errand
would be in the wilderness of forest where Orellana and his
followers found themselves when they reached the Napo, and how
strong their disinclination would be to return against the currents
and rapids which they had descended. The idea then seized them to
commit themselves to the chances of the stream, although ignorant
whither it would lead. So onward they went. From the Napo they
emerged into the main Amazons, and, after many and various
adventures with the Indians on its banks, reached the
Atlantic&mdash; eight months from the date of their entering the
great river.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Another remarkable voyage was accomplished, in a similar manner,
by a Spaniard named Lopez d&rsquo;Aguirre, from Cusco, in Peru,
down the Ucayali, a branch of the Amazons flowing from the south,
and therefore, from an opposite direction to that of the Napo. An
account of this journey was sent by D&rsquo;Aguirre, in a letter to
the King of Spain, from which Humboldt has given an extract in his
narrative. As it is a good specimen of the quaintness of style and
looseness of statement exhibited by these early narrators of
adventures in South America, I will give a translation of it:
&ldquo;We constructed rafts, and, leaving behind our horses and
baggage, sailed down the river (the Ucayali) with great risk, until
we found ourselves in a gulf of fresh water. In this river Maranon
we continued more than ten months and a half, down to its mouth,
where it falls into the sea. We made one hundred days&rsquo;
journey, and travelled 1500 leagues. It is a great and fearful
stream, has 80 leagues of fresh water at its mouth, vast shoals,
and 800 leagues of wilderness without any kind of
inhabitants,<sup><a href="#1">2</a></sup> as your Majesty will see
from the true and correct narrative of the journey which we have
made. It has more than 6000 islands. God knows how we came out of
this fearful sea!&rdquo; Many expeditions were undertaken in the
course of the eighteenth century; in fact, the crossing of the
continent from the Pacific to the Atlantic, by way of the Amazons,
seems to have become by this time a common occurrence. The only
voyage, however, which yielded much scientific information to the
European public was that of the French astronomer, La Condamine, in
1743-4. The most complete account yet published of the river is
that given by Von Martius in the third volume of Spix and
Martius&rsquo; Travels. These most accomplished travellers were
eleven months in the country&mdash;namely, from July, 1819, to
June, 1820&mdash;and ascended the river to the frontiers of the
Brazilian territory. The accounts they have given of the geography,
ethnology, botany, history, and statistics of the Amazons region
are the most complete that have ever been given to the world. Their
narrative was not published until 1831, and was unfortunately
inaccessible to me during the time I travelled in the same
country.</p>

<br>
<p>Whilst preparing for my voyage it happened, fortunately, that
the half-brother of Dr. Angelo Custodio, a young mestizo named Joao
da Cunha Correia, was about to start for the Amazons on a trading
expedition in his own vessel, a schooner of about forty tons&rsquo;
burthen. A passage for me was soon arranged with him through the
intervention of Dr. Angelo, and we started on the 5th of September,
1849. I intended to stop at some village on the northern shore of
the Lower Amazons, where it would be interesting to make
collections, in order to show the relations of the fauna to those
of Par&aacute; and the coast region of Guiana. As I should have to
hire a house or hut wherever I stayed, I took all the materials for
housekeeping&mdash;cooking utensils, crockery, and so forth. To
these were added a stock of such provisions as it would be
difficult to obtain in the interior; also ammunition, chests,
store-boxes, a small library of natural history books, and a
hundredweight of copper money. I engaged, after some trouble, a
Mameluco youth to accompany me as servant&mdash;a short, fat,
yellow-faced boy named Luco, whom I had already employed at
Par&aacute; in collecting. We weighed anchor at night, and on the
following day found ourselves gliding along the dark-brown waters
of the Moj&uacute;.</p>

<p>Joao da Cunha, like most of his fellow countrymen, took matters
very easily. He was going to be absent in the interior several
years, and therefore, intended to diverge from his route to visit
his native place, Camet&aacute;, and spend a few days with his
friends. It seemed not to matter to him that he had a cargo of
merchandise, vessel, and crew of twelve persons, which required an
economical use of time; &ldquo;pleasure first and business
afterwards&rdquo; appeared to be his maxim. We stayed at
Camet&aacute; twelve days. The chief motive for prolonging the stay
to this extent was a festival at the Aldeia, two miles below
Camet&aacute;, which was to commence on the 21st, and which my
friend wished to take part in. On the day of the festival the
schooner was sent down to anchor off the Aldeia, and master and men
gave themselves up to revelry. In the evening a strong breeze
sprang up, and orders were given to embark. We scrambled down in
the dark through the thickets of cacao, orange, and coffee trees
which clothed the high bank, and, after running great risk of being
swamped by the heavy sea in the crowded montaria, got all aboard by
nine o&rsquo;clock. We made all sail amidst the &ldquo;adios&rdquo;
shouted to us by Indian and mulatto sweethearts from the top of the
bank, and, tide and wind being favourable, were soon miles
away.</p>

<p>Our crew consisted, as already mentioned, of twelve persons. One
was a young Portuguese from the province of Traz os Montes, a
pretty sample of the kind of emigrants which Portugal sends to
Brazil. He was two or three and twenty years of age, and had been
about two years in the country, dressing and living like the
Indians, to whom he was certainly inferior in manners. He could not
read or write, whereas one at least of our Tapuyos had both
accomplishments. He had a little wooden image of Nossa Senhora in
his rough wooden clothes-chest, and to this he always had recourse
when any squall arose, or when we ran aground on a shoal. Another
of our sailors was a tawny white of Camet&aacute;; the rest were
Indians, except the cook, who was a Cafuzo, or half-breed between
the Indian and negro. It is often said that this class of mestizos
is the most evilly-disposed of all the numerous crosses between the
races inhabiting Brazil; but Luiz was a simple, good-hearted
fellow, always ready to do one a service. The pilot was an old
Tapuyo of Par&aacute;, with regular oval face and well-shaped
features. I was astonished at his endurance. He never quitted the
helm night or day, except for two or three hours in the morning.
The other Indians used to bring him his coffee and meals, and after
breakfast one of them relieved him for a time, when he used to lie
down on the quarterdeck and get his two hours&rsquo; nap. The
Indians forward had things pretty much their own way. No system of
watches was followed; when any one was so disposed, he lay down on
the deck and went to sleep; but a feeling of good fellowship seemed
always to exist amongst them. One of them was a fine specimen of
the Indian race&mdash;a man just short of six feet high, with
remarkable breadth of shoulder and full muscular chest. His
comrades called him the commandant, on account of his having been
one of the rebel leaders when the Indians and others took Santarem
in 1835. They related of him that, when the legal authorities
arrived with an armed flotilla to recapture the town, he was one of
the last to quit, remaining in the little fortress which commands
the place to make a show of loading the guns, although the
ammunition had given out long ago. Such were our travelling
companions. We lived almost the same as on board ship. Our meals
were cooked in the galley; but, where practicable, and during our
numerous stoppages, the men went in the montaria to fish near the
shore, so that our breakfasts and dinners of salt pirarucu were
sometimes varied with fresh food.</p>

<p><i>September 24th.</i>&mdash;We passed Entre-as-Ilhas with the
morning tide yesterday, and then made across to the eastern
shore&mdash;the starting-point for all canoes which have to
traverse the broad mouth of the Tocantins going west. Early this
morning we commenced the passage. The navigation is attended with
danger on account of the extensive shoals in the middle of the
river, which are covered only by a small depth of water at this
season of the year. The wind was fresh, and the schooner rolled and
pitched like a ship at sea. The distance was about fifteen miles.
In the middle, the river-view was very imposing. Towards the
northeast there was a long sweep of horizon clear of land, and on
the southwest stretched a similar boundless expanse, but varied
with islets clothed with fan-leaved palms, which, however, were
visible only as isolated groups of columns, tufted at the top,
rising here and there amidst the waste of waters. In the afternoon
we rounded the westernmost point; the land, which is not terra
firma, but simply a group of large islands forming a portion of the
Tocantins delta, was then about three miles distant.</p>

<p>On the following day (25th) we sailed towards the west, along
the upper portion of the Par&aacute; estuary, which extends seventy
miles beyond the mouth of the Tocantins. It varies in width from
three to five miles, but broadens rapidly near its termination,
where it is eight or nine miles wide. The northern shore is formed
by the island of Maraj&oacute;, and is slightly elevated and rocky
in some parts. A series of islands conceals the southern shore from
view most of the way. The whole country, mainland and islands, is
covered with forest. We had a good wind all day, and about 7 p.m.
entered the narrow river of Breves, which commences abruptly the
extensive labyrinth of channels that connects the Par&aacute; with
the Amazons. The sudden termination of the Par&aacute; at a point
where it expands to so great a breadth is remarkable; the water,
however, is very shallow over the greater portion of the expanse. I
noticed both on this and on the three subsequent occasions of
passing this place in ascending and descending the river, that the
flow of the tide from the east along the estuary, as well as up the
Breves, was very strong. This seems sufficient to prove that no
considerable volume of water passes by this medium from the Amazons
to the Par&aacute;, and that the opinion of those geographers is an
incorrect one, who believe the Par&aacute; to be one of the mouths
of the great river. There is, however, another channel connecting
the two rivers, which enters the Par&aacute; six miles to the south
of the Breves. The lower part of its course for eighteen miles is
formed by the Uanap&uacute;, a large and independent river flowing
from the south. The tidal flow is said by the natives to produce
little or no current up this river&mdash;a fact which seems to
afford a little support to the view just stated.</p>

<p>We passed the village of Breves at 3 p.m. on the 26th. It
consists of about forty houses, most of which are occupied by
Portuguese shopkeepers. A few Indian families reside here, who
occupy themselves with the manufacture of ornamental pottery and
painted cuyas, which they sell to traders or passing travellers.
The cuyas&mdash;drinking-cups made from gourds&mdash;are sometimes
very tastefully painted. The rich black ground-colour is produced
by a dye made from the bark of a tree called Comateu, the gummy
nature of which imparts a fine polish. The yellow tints are made
with the Tabatinga clay; the red with the seeds of the Urucu, or
anatto plant; and the blue with indigo, which is planted round the
huts. The art is indigenous with the Amazonian Indians, but it is
only the settled agricultural tribes belonging to the Tup&iacute;
stock who practise it.</p>

<p><i>September 27th-30th.</i>&mdash;After passing Breves, we
continued our way slowly along a channel, or series of channels, of
variable width. On the morning of the 27th we had a fair wind, the
breadth of the stream varying from about 150 to 400 yards. About
midday we passed, on the western side, the mouth of the Aturiazal,
through which, on account of its swifter current, vessels pass in
descending from the Amazons to Par&aacute;. Shortly afterwards we
entered the narrow channel of the Jabur&uacute;, which lies twenty
miles above the mouth of the Breves. Here commences the peculiar
scenery of this remarkable region. We found ourselves in a narrow
and nearly straight canal, not more than eighty to a hundred yards
in width, and hemmed in by two walls of forest, which rose quite
perpendicularly from the water to a height of seventy or eighty
feet. The water was of great and uniform depth, even close to the
banks. We seemed to be in a deep gorge, and the strange impression
the place produced was augmented by the dull echoes wakened by the
voices of our Indians and the splash of their paddles. The forest
was excessively varied. Some of the trees, the dome-topped giants
of the Leguminous and Bombaceous orders, reared their heads far
above the average height of the green walls. The fan-leaved
Mirit&iacute; palm was scattered in some numbers amidst the rest, a
few solitary specimens shooting up their smooth columns above the
other trees. The graceful Assai palm grew in little groups, forming
feathery pictures set in the rounder foliage of the mass. The
Ubuss&uacute;, lower in height, showed only its shuttlecock shaped
crowns of huge undivided fronds, which, being of a vivid
pale-green, contrasted forcibly against the sombre hues of the
surrounding foliage. The Ubuss&uacute; grew here in great numbers;
the equally remarkable Jupati palm (Rhaphia taedigera), which, like
the Ubuss&uacute;, is peculiar to this district, occurred more
sparsely, throwing its long shaggy leaves, forty to fifty feet in
length, in broad arches over the canal. An infinite diversity of
smaller-sized palms decorated the water&rsquo;s edge, such as the
Maraj&aacute;-i (Bactris, many species), the Ubim (Geonoma), and a
few stately Bac&aacute;bas (&OElig;nocarpus Bacaba). The shape of
this last is exceedingly elegant, the size of the crown being in
proper proportion to the straight smooth stem. The leaves, down
even to the bases of the glossy petioles, are of a rich dark-green
colour, and free from spines. &ldquo;The forest wall&rdquo;&mdash;I
am extracting from my journal&mdash;&ldquo;under which we are now
moving, consists, besides palms, of a great variety of ordinary
forest trees. From the highest branches of these down to the water
sweep ribbons of climbing plants of the most diverse and ornamental
foliage possible. Creeping convolvuli and others have made use of
the slender lianas and hanging air roots as ladders to climb by.
Now and then appears a Mimosa or other tree having similar fine
pinnate foliage, and thick masses of Ing&aacute; border the water,
from whose branches hang long bean-pods, of different shape and
size according to the species, some of them a yard in length.
Flowers there are very few. I see, now and then, a gorgeous crimson
blossom on long spikes ornamenting the sombre foliage towards the
summits of the forest. I suppose it to belong to a climber of the
Combretaceous order. There are also a few yellow and violet
Trumpet-flowers (Bignoni&aelig;). The blossoms of the Ing&aacute;s,
although not conspicuous, are delicately beautiful. The forest all
along offers so dense a front that one never obtains a glimpse into
the interior of the wilderness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The length of the Jabur&uacute; channel is about thirty-five
miles, allowing for the numerous abrupt bends which occur between
the middle and the northern end of its course. We were three days
and a half accomplishing the passage. The banks on each side seemed
to be composed of hard river-mud with a thick covering of vegetable
mold, so that I should imagine this whole district originated in a
gradual accumulation of alluvium, through which the endless
labyrinths of channels have worked their deep and narrow beds. The
flood-tide as we travelled northward became gradually of less
assistance to us, as it caused only a feeble current upwards. The
pressure of the waters from the Amazons here makes itself felt: as
this is not the case lower down, I suppose the currents are
diverted through some of the numerous channels which we passed on
our right, and which traverse, in their course towards the sea, the
north-western part of Maraj&amp;o&dagger;. In the evening of the
29th we arrived at a point where another channel joins the
Jabur&uacute; from the north-east. Up this the tide was flowing; we
turned westward, and thus met the flood coming from the Amazons.
This point is the object of a strange superstitious observance on
the part of the canoemen. It is said to be haunted by a
Paj&eacute;, or Indian wizard, whom it is necessary to propitiate
by depositing some article on the spot, if the voyager wishes to
secure a safe return from the &ldquo;serta&ocirc;,&rdquo; as the
interior of the country is called. The trees were all hung with
rags, shirts, straw hats, bunches of fruit, and so forth. Although
the superstition doubtless originated with the aborigines, I
observed in both my voyages, that it was only the Portuguese and
uneducated Brazilians who deposited anything. The pure Indians gave
nothing, and treated the whole affair as a humbug; but they were
all civilised Tapuyos.</p>

<p>On the 30th, at 9 p.m., we reached a broad channel called
Macaco, and now left the dark, echoing Jabur&uacute;. The Macaco
sends off branches towards the north-west coast of Maraj&oacute;.
It is merely a passage amongst a cluster of islands, between which
a glimpse is occasionally obtained of the broad waters of the main
Amazons. A brisk wind carried us rapidly past its monotonous
scenery, and early in the morning of the 1st of October we reached
the entrance of the Uituquara, or the Wind-hole, which is fifteen
miles distant from the end of the Jabur&uacute;. This is also a
winding channel, thirty-five miles in length, threading a group of
islands, but it is much narrower than the Macaco.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig12.jpg" width="338" height="194" alt=
"Acari Fish (Loricaria duodecimalis)."></center>

<p>On emerging from the Uituqu&aacute;ra on the 2nd, we all went
ashore&mdash;the men to fish in a small creek; Joao da Cunha and I
to shoot birds. We saw a flock of scarlet and blue macaws
(Macrocercus Macao) feeding on the fruits of a Bac&aacute;ba palm,
and looking like a cluster of flaunting banners beneath its
dark-green crown. We landed about fifty yards from the place, and
crept cautiously through the forest, but before we reached them
they flew off with loud harsh screams. At a wild fruit tree we were
more successful, as my companion shot an anac&aacute; (Derotypus
coronatus), one of the most beautiful of the parrot family. It is
of a green colour, and has a hood of feathers, red bordered with
blue, at the back of its head, which it can elevate or depress at
pleasure. The anac&aacute; is the only new-world parrot which
nearly resembles the cockatoo of Australia. It is found in all the
lowlands throughout the Amazons region, but is not a common bird
anywhere. Few persons succeed in taming it, and I never saw one
that had been taught to speak. The natives are very fond of the
bird nevertheless, and keep it in their houses for the sake of
seeing the irascible creature expand its beautiful frill of
feathers, which it readily does when excited. The men returned with
a large quantity of fish. I was surprised at the great variety of
species; the prevailing kind was a species of Loricaria, a foot in
length, and wholly encased in bony armour. It abounds at certain
seasons in shallow water. The flesh is dry, but very palatable.
They brought also a small alligator, which they called Jacare
curua, and said it was a kind found only in shallow creeks. It was
not more than two feet in length, although full-grown according to
the statement of the Indians, who said it was a &ldquo;mai
d&rsquo;ovos,&rdquo; or mother of eggs, as they had pillaged the
nest, which they had found near the edge of the water. The eggs
were rather larger than a hen&rsquo;s, and regularly oval in shape,
presenting a rough hard surface of shell. Unfortunately, the
alligator was cut up ready for cooking when we returned to the
schooner, and I could not therefore make a note of its
peculiarities. The pieces were skewered and roasted over the fire,
each man being his own cook. I never saw this species of alligator
afterwards.</p>

<p><i>October 3rd.</i>&mdash;About midnight the wind, for which we
had long been waiting, sprang up; the men weighed anchor, and we
were soon fairly embarked on the Amazons. I rose long before
sunrise to see the great river by moonlight. There was a spanking
breeze, and the vessel was bounding gaily over the waters. The
channel along which we were sailing was only a narrow arm of the
river, about two miles in width: the total breadth at this point is
more than twenty miles, but the stream is divided into three parts
by a series of large islands. The river, notwithstanding this
limitation of its breadth, had a most majestic appearance. It did
not present that lake-like aspect which the waters of the
Par&aacute; and Tocantins affect, but had all the swing, so to
speak, of a vast flowing stream. The ochre-coloured turbid waters
offered also a great contrast to the rivers belonging to the
Par&aacute; system. The channel formed a splendid reach, sweeping
from south-west to north-east, with a horizon of water and sky both
upstream and down. At 11 a.m. we arrived at Gurup&aacute;, a small
village situated on a rocky bank thirty or forty feet high. Here we
landed, and I had an opportunity of rambling in the neighbouring
woods, which are intersected by numerous pathways, and carpeted
with Lycopodia growing to a height of eight or ten inches, and
enlivened by numbers of glossy blue butterflies of the
Theclid&aelig; or hairstreak family. At 5 p.m. we were again under
way. Soon after sunset, as we were crossing the mouth of the
Xing&uacute;, the first of the great tributaries of the Amazons,
1200 miles in length, a black cloud arose suddenly in the
northeast. Joao da Cunha ordered all sails to be taken in, and
immediately afterwards a furious squall burst forth, tearing the
waters into foam, and producing a frightful uproar in the
neighbouring forests. A drenching rain followed, but in half an
hour all was again calm and the full moon appeared sailing in a
cloudless sky.</p>

<p>From the mouth of the Xing&uacute; the route followed by vessels
leads straight across the river, here ten miles broad. Towards
midnight the wind failed us, when we were close to a large shoal
called the Baixo Grande. We lay here becalmed in the sickening heat
for two days, and when the trade-wind recommenced with the rising
moon at 10 p.m. on the 6th, we found ourselves on a lee-shore.
Notwithstanding all the efforts of our pilot to avoid it, we ran
aground. Fortunately the bottom consisted only of soft mud, so that
by casting anchor to windward, and hauling in with the whole
strength of crew and passengers, we got off after spending an
uncomfortable night. We rounded the point of the shoal in two
fathoms&rsquo; water; the head of the vessel was then put westward,
and by sunrise we were bounding forward before a steady breeze, all
sail set and everybody in good humour.</p>

<p>The weather was now delightful for several days in succession,
the air transparently clear, and the breeze cool and invigorating.
At daylight, on the 6th, a chain of blue hills, the Serra de
Almeyrim, appeared in the distance on the north bank of the river.
The sight was most exhilarating after so long a sojourn in a flat
country. We kept to the southern shore, passing in the course of
the day the mouths of the Urucuric&aacute;ya and the
Aquiqu&iacute;, two channels which communicate with the
Xing&uacute;. The whole of this southern coast hence to near
Santarem, a distance of 130 miles, is lowland and quite
uninhabited. It is intersected by short arms or back waters of the
Amazons, which are called in the Tupi language
Par&aacute;na-mirims, or little rivers. By keeping to these, small
canoes can travel a great part of the distance without being much
exposed to the heavy seas of the main river. The coast throughout
has a most desolate aspect; the forest is not so varied as on the
higher land; and the water-frontage, which is destitute of the
green mantle of climbing plants that form so rich a decoration in
other parts, is encumbered at every step with piles of fallen
trees; and peopled by white egrets, ghostly storks, and solitary
herons. In the evening we passed Almeyrim. The hills, according to
Von Martius, who landed here, are about 800 feet above the level of
the river, and are thickly wooded to the summit. They commence on
the east by a few low isolated and rounded elevations; but towards
the west of the village, they assume the appearance of elongated
ridges which seem as if they had been planed down to a uniform
height by some external force. The next day we passed in succession
a series of similar flat-topped hills, some isolated and of a
truncated-pyramidal shape, others prolonged to a length of several
miles. There is an interval of low country between these and the
Almeyrim range, which has a total length of about twenty-five
miles; then commences abruptly the Serra de Marauaqua, which is
succeeded in a similar way by the Velha Pobre range, the Serras de
Tapaiuna-qu&aacute;ra, and Parau&aacute;-qu&aacute;ra. All these
form a striking contrast to the Serra de Almeyrim in being quite
destitute of trees. They have steep rugged sides, apparently
clothed with short herbage, but here and there exposing bare white
patches. Their total length is about forty miles. In the rear,
towards the interior, they are succeeded by other ranges of hills
communicating with the central mountain-chain of Guiana, which
divides Brazil from Cayenne.</p>

<p>As we sailed along the southern shore, during the 6th and two
following days, the table-topped hills on the opposite side
occupied most of our attention. The river is from four to five
miles broad, and in some places long, low wooded islands intervene
in mid-stream, whose light-green, vivid verdure formed a strangely
beautiful foreground to the glorious landscape of broad stream and
grey mountain. Ninety miles beyond Almeyrim stands the village of
Monte Alegre, which is built near the summit of the last hill
visible of this chain. At this point the river bends a little
towards the south, and the hilly country recedes from its shores to
re-appear at Obydos, greatly decreased in height, about a hundred
miles further west.</p>

"Flat-topped mountains of Paraua-quara, lower Amazons."></center>

<p>We crossed the river three times between Monte Alegre and the
next town, Santarem. In the middle the waves ran very high, and the
vessel lurched fearfully, hurling everything that was not well
secured from one side of the deck to the other. On the morning of
the 9th of October, a gentle wind carried us along a
&ldquo;remanso,&rdquo; or still water, under the southern shore.
These tracts of quiet water are frequent on the irregular sides of
the stream, and are the effect of counter movements caused by the
rapid current of its central parts. At 9 a.m. we passed the mouth
of a Paran&aacute;-mirim, called Mahic&aacute;, and then found a
sudden change in the colour of the water and aspect of the banks.
Instead of the low and swampy water-frontage which had prevailed
from the mouth of the Xing&uacute;, we saw before us a broad
sloping beach of white sand. The forest, instead of being an
entangled mass of irregular and rank vegetation as hitherto,
presented a rounded outline, and created an impresssion of repose
that was very pleasing. We now approached, in fact, the mouth of
the Tapajos, whose clear olive-green waters here replaced the muddy
current against which we had so long been sailing. Although this is
a river of great extent&mdash;1000 miles in length, and, for the
last eighty miles of its course, four to ten in breadth&mdash;its
contribution to the Amazons is not perceptible in the middle of the
stream. The white turbid current of the main river flows
disdainfully by, occupying nearly the whole breadth of the channel,
whilst the darker water of its tributary seems to creep along the
shore, and is no longer distinguishable four or five miles from its
mouth.</p>

<p>We reached Santarem at 11 a.m. The town has a clean and cheerful
appearance from the river. It consists of three long streets, with
a few short ones crossing them at right angles, and contains about
2500 inhabitants. It lies just within the mouth of Tapajos, and is
divided into two parts, the town and the aldeia or village. The
houses of the white and trading classes are substantially built,
many being of two and three stories, and all white-washed and
tiled. The aldeia, which contains the Indian portion of the
population, or did so formerly, consists mostly of mud huts,
thatched with palm leaves. The situation of the town is very
beautiful. The land, although but slightly elevated, does not form,
strictly speaking, a portion of the alluvial river plains of the
Amazons, but is rather a northern prolongation of the Brazilian
continental land. It is scantily wooded, and towards the interior
consists of undulating campos, which are connected with a series of
hills extending southward as far as the eye can reach. I
subsequently made this place my head-quarters for three years; an
account of its neighbourhood is therefore, reserved for another
chapter. At the first sight of Santarem, one cannot help being
struck with the advantages of its situation. Although 400 miles
from the sea, it is accessible to vessels of heavy tonnage coming
straight from the Atlantic. The river has only two slight bends
between this port and the sea, and for five or six months in the
year the Amazonian trade wind blows with very little interruption,
so that sailing ships coming from foreign countries could reach the
place with little difficulty. We ourselves had accomplished 200
miles, or about half the distance from the sea, in an ill-rigged
vessel, in three days and a half. Although the land in the
immediate neighbourhood is perhaps ill adapted for agriculture, an
immense tract of rich soil, with forest and meadowland, lies on the
opposite banks of the river, and the Tapajos leads into the heart
of the mining provinces of interior Brazil. But where is the
population to come from to develop the resources of this fine
country? At present, the district within a radius of twenty-five
miles contains barely 6500 inhabitants; behind the town, towards
the interior, the country is uninhabited, and jaguars roam nightly,
at least in the rainy season, close up to the ends of the suburban
streets.</p>

<p>From information obtained here, I fixed upon the next town,
Obydos, as the best place to stay for a few weeks, in order to
investigate the natural productions of the north side of the Lower
Amazons. We started at sunrise on the 10th, and being still
favoured by wind and weather, made a pleasant passage, reaching
Obydos, which is nearly fifty miles distant from Santarem, by
midnight. We sailed all day close to the southern shore, and found
the banks here and there dotted with houses of settlers, each
surrounded by its plantation of cacao, which is the staple product
of the district. This coast has an evil reputation for storms and
mosquitoes, but we fortunately escaped both. It was remarkable that
we had been troubled by mosquitoes only on one night, and then to a
small degree, during the whole of our voyage.</p>

<p>I landed at Obydos the next morning, and then bid adieu to my
kind friend Joao da Cunha, who, after landing my baggage, got up
his anchor and continued on his way. The town contains about 1200
inhabitants, and is airily situated on a high bluff, ninety or a
hundred feet above the level of the river. The coast is precipitous
for two or three miles hence to the west. The cliffs consist of the
parti-coloured clay, or Tabatinga, which occurs so frequently
throughout the Amazons region; the strong current of the river sets
full against them in the season of high water, and annually carries
away large portions. The clay in places is stratified alternately
pink and yellow, the pink beds being the thickest and of much
harder texture than the others. When I descended the river in 1859,
a German Major of Engineers, in the employ of the Government, told
me that he had found calcareous layers, thickly studded with marine
shells interstratified with the clay. On the top of the Tabatinga
lies a bed of sand, in some places several feet thick, and the
whole formation rests on strata of sandstone, which are exposed
only when the river reaches its lowest level. Behind the town rises
a fine rounded hill, and a range of similar elevations extends six
miles westward, terminating at the mouth of the Trombetas, a large
river flowing through the interior of Guiana. Hills and lowlands
alike are covered with a sombre rolling forest. The river here is
contracted to a breadth of rather less than a mile (1738 yards),
and the entire volume of its waters, the collective product of a
score of mighty streams, is poured through the strait with
tremendous velocity. It must be remarked, however, that the river
valley itself is not contracted to this breadth, the opposite shore
not being continental land, but a low alluvial tract, subject to
inundation more or less in the rainy season. Behind it lies an
extensive lake, called the Lago Grande da Villa Franca, which
communicates with the Amazons, both above and below Obydos, and has
therefore the appearance of a by-water or an old channel of the
river. This lake is about thirty-five miles in length, and from
four to ten in width; but its waters are of little depth, and in
the dry season its dimensions are much lessened. It has no
perceptible current, and does not therefore now divert any portion
of the waters of the Amazons from their main course past
Obydos.</p>

<p>I remained at Obydos from the 11th of October to the 19th of
November. I spent three weeks here, also, in 1859, when the place
was much changed through the influx of Portuguese immigrants and
the building of a fortress on the top of the bluff. It is one of
the pleasantest towns on the river. The houses are all roofed with
tiles, and are mostly of substantial architecture. The inhabitants,
at least at the time of my first visit, were naive in their ways,
kind and sociable. Scarcely any palm-thatched huts are to be seen,
for very few Indians now reside here. It was one of the early
settlements of the Portuguese, and the better class of the
population consists of old-established white families, who exhibit
however, in some cases, traces of cross with the Indian and negro.
Obydos and Santarem have received, during the last eighty years,
considerable importations of negro slaves; before that time, a
cruel traffic was carried on in Indians for the same purpose of
forced servitude, but their numbers have gradually dwindled away,
and Indians now form an insignificant element in the population of
the district. Most of the Obydos townsfolk are owners of cacao
plantations, which are situated on the low lands in the vicinity.
Some are large cattle proprietors, and possess estates of many
square leagues&rsquo; extent in the campo, or grass-land districts,
which border the Lago Grande, and other similar inland lakes, near
the villages of Faro and Alemquer. These campos bear a crop of
nutritious grass; but in certain seasons, when the rising of the
Amazons exceeds the average, they are apt to be flooded, and then
the large herds of half wild cattle suffer great mortality from
drowning, hunger, and alligators. Neither in cattle-keeping nor
cacao-growing are any but the laziest and most primitive methods
followed, and the consequence is that the proprietors are generally
poor. A few, however, have become rich by applying a moderate
amount of industry and skill to the management of their estates.
People spoke of several heiresses in the neighbourhood whose wealth
was reckoned in oxen and slaves; a dozen slaves and a few hundred
head of cattle being considered a great fortune. Some of them I saw
had already been appropriated by enterprising young men, who had
come from Par&aacute; and Maranham to seek their fortunes in this
quarter.</p>

<p>The few weeks I spent here passed away pleasantly. I generally
spent the evenings in the society of the townspeople, who
associated together (contrary to Brazilian custom) in European
fashion; the different families meeting at one another&rsquo;s
houses for social amusement, bachelor friends not being excluded,
and the whole company, married and single, joining in simple games.
The meetings used to take place in the sitting-rooms, and not in
the open verandahs&mdash;a fashion almost compulsory on account of
the mosquitoes; but the evenings here are very cool, and the
closeness of a room is not so much felt as it is in Par&aacute;.
Sunday was strictly observed at Obydos&mdash;at least all the shops
were closed, and almost the whole population went to church. The
Vicar, Padre Raimundo do Sanchez Brito, was an excellent old man,
and I fancy the friendly manners of the people, and the general
purity of morals at Obydos, were owing in great part to the good
example he set to his parishioners.</p>

<p>The forest at Obydos seemed to abound in monkeys, for I rarely
passed a day without seeing several. I noticed four species: the
Coait&aacute; (Ateles paniscus), the Chrysothrix sciureus, the
Callithrix torquatus, and our old Par&aacute; friend, Midas
ursulus. The Coait&aacute; is a large black monkey, covered with
coarse hair, and having the prominent parts of the face of a tawny
flesh-coloured hue. It is the largest of the Amazonian monkeys in
stature, but is excelled in bulk by the &ldquo;Barrigudo&rdquo;
(Lagothrix Humboldtii) of the Upper Amazons. It occurs throughout
the lowlands of the Lower and Upper Amazons, but does not range to
the south beyond the limits of the river plains. At that point an
allied species, the White-whiskered Coait&aacute; (Ateles
marginatus) takes its place. The Coait&aacute;s are called by
zoologists spider monkeys, on account of the length and slenderness
of their body and limbs. In these apes the tail, as a prehensile
organ, reaches its highest degree of perfection; and on this
account it would, perhaps, be correct to consider the
Coait&aacute;s as the extreme development of the American type of
apes. As far as we know, from living and fossil species, the New
World has progressed no farther than the Coait&aacute; towards the
production of a higher form of the Quadrumanous order. The tendency
of Nature here has been, to all appearance, simply to perfect those
organs which adapt the species more and more completely to a purely
arboreal life; and no nearer approach has been made towards the
more advanced forms of anthropoid apes, which are the products of
the Old World solely. The flesh of this monkey is much esteemed by
the natives in this part of the country, and the Military
Commandant of Obydos, Major Gama, every week sent a negro hunter to
shoot one for his table. One day I went on a Coait&aacute; hunt,
borrowing a negro slave of a friend to show me the way. When in the
deepest part of a ravine we heard a rustling sound in the trees
overhead, and Manoel soon pointed out a Coait&aacute; to me. There
was something human-like in its appearance, as the lean, dark,
shaggy creature moved deliberately amongst the branches at a great
height. I fired, but unfortunately only wounded it in the belly. It
fell with a crash headlong about twenty or thirty feet, and then
caught a bough with its tail, which grasped it instantaneously, and
then the animal remained suspended in mid-air. Before I could
reload, it recovered itself and mounted nimbly to the topmost
branches out of the reach of a fowling-piece, where we could
perceive the poor thing apparently probing the wound with its
fingers. Coait&aacute;s are more frequently kept in a tame state
than any other kind of monkey. The Indians are very fond of them as
pets, and the women often suckle them when young at their breasts.
They become attached to their masters, and will sometimes follow
them on the ground to considerable distances. I once saw a most
ridiculously tame Coait&aacute;. It was an old female which
accompanied its owner, a trader on the river, in all his voyages.
By way of giving me a specimen of its intelligence and feeling, its
master set to and rated it soundly, calling it scamp, heathen,
thief, and so forth, all through the copious Portuguese vocabulary
of vituperation. The poor monkey, quietly seated on the ground,
seemed to be in sore trouble at this display of anger. It began by
looking earnestly at him, then it whined, and lastly rocked its
body to and fro with emotion, crying piteously, and passing its
long gaunt arms continually over its forehead; for this was its
habit when excited, and the front of the head was worn quite bald
in consequence. At length its master altered his tone.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a lie, my old woman; you&rsquo;re an angel, a
flower, a good affectionate old creature,&rdquo; and so forth.
Immediately the poor monkey ceased its wailing, and soon after came
over to where the man sat. The disposition of the Coait&aacute; is
mild in the extreme: it has none of the painful, restless vivacity
of its kindred, the Cebi, and no trace of the surly, untameable
temper of its still nearer relatives, the Mycetes, or howling
monkeys. It is, however, an arrant thief, and shows considerable
cunning in pilfering small articles of clothing, which it conceals
in its sleeping place. The natives of the Upper Amazons procure the
Coait&aacute;, when full grown, by shooting it with the blowpipe
and poisoned darts, and restoring life by putting a little salt
(the antidote to the Urar&iacute; poison with which the darts are
tipped) in its mouth. The animals thus caught become tame
forthwith. Two females were once kept at the Jardin des Plantes of
Paris, and Geoffroy St. Hilaire relates of them that they rarely
quitted each other, remaining most of the time in close embrace,
folding their tails around one another&rsquo;s bodies. They took
their meals together; and it was remarked on such occasions, when
the friendship of animals is put to a hard test, that they never
quarrelled or disputed the possession of a favourite fruit with
each other.</p>

"Heliconius Thelxiope and Heliconius Melpomene."></center>

<p>The neighbourhood of Obydos was rich also in insects. In the
broad alleys of the forest a magnificent butterfly of the genus
Morpho, six to eight inches in expanse, the Morpho Hecuba, was seen
daily gliding along at a height of twenty feet or more from the
ground. Amongst the lower trees and bushes numerous kinds of
Heliconii, a group of butterflies peculiar to tropical America,
having long narrow wings, were very abundant. The prevailing ground
colour of the wings of these insects is a deep black, and on this
are depicted spots and streaks of crimson, white, and bright
yellow, in different patterns according to the species. Their
elegant shape, showy colours, and slow, sailing mode of flight,
make them very attractive objects, and their numbers are so great
that they form quite a feature in the physiognomy of the forest,
compensating for the scarcity of flowers. Next to the Heliconii,
the Catagrammas (C. astarte and C. peristera) were the most
conspicuous. These have a very rapid and short flight, settling
frequently and remaining stationary for a long time on the trunks
of trees. The colours of their wings are vermilion and black, the
surface having a rich velvety appearance. The genus owes its Greek
name Catagramma (signifying &ldquo;a letter beneath&rdquo;) to the
curious markings of the underside of the wings, resembling Arabic
numerals. The species and varieties are of almost endless
diversity, but the majority inhabit the hot valleys of the eastern
parts of the Andes. Another butterfly nearly allied to these,
Callithea Leprieurii, was also very abundant here at the marshy
head of the pool before mentioned. The wings are of a rich
dark-blue colour, with a broad border of silvery green. These two
groups of Callithea and Catagramma are found only in tropical
America, chiefly near the equator, and are certainly amongst the
most beautiful productions of a region where the animals and plants
seem to have been fashioned in nature&rsquo;s choicest moulds. A
great variety of other beautiful and curious insects adorned these
pleasant woods. Others were seen only in the sunshine in open
places. As the waters retreated from the beach, vast numbers of
sulphur-yellow and orange coloured butterflies congregated on the
moist sand. The greater portion of them belonged to the genus
Callidryas. They assembled in densely-packed masses, sometimes two
or three yards in circumference, their wings all held in an upright
position, so that the beach looked as though variegated with beds
of crocuses. These Callidryades seem to be migratory insects, and
have large powers of dissemination. During the last two days of our
voyage, the great numbers constantly passing over the river
attracted the attention of every one on board. They all crossed in
one direction, namely, from north to south, and the processions
were uninterrupted from an early hour in the morning until sunset.
All the individuals which resort to the margins of sandy beaches
are of the male sex. The females are much more rare, and are seen
only on the borders of the forest, wandering from tree to tree, and
depositing their eggs on low mimosas which grow in the shade. The
migrating hordes, as far as I could ascertain, are composed only of
males, and on this account I believe their wanderings do not extend
very far.</p>

"Musical Cricket (Chloorocoelus Tanana). a. b. Lobes of wing-cases transformed into a musical instrument.">
</center>

<p>A strange kind of wood-cricket is found in this neighbourhood,
the males of which produce a very loud and not unmusical noise by
rubbing together the overlapping edges of their wing-cases. The
notes are certainly the loudest and most extraordinary that I ever
heard produced by an orthopterous insect. The natives call it the
Tanan&aacute;, in allusion to its music, which is a sharp, resonant
stridulation resembling the syllables ta-na-n&aacute;,
ta-na-n&aacute;, succeeding each other with little intermission. It
seems to be rare in the neighbourhood. When the natives capture
one, they keep it in a wicker-work cage for the sake of hearing it
sing. A friend of mine kept one six days. It was lively only for
two or three, and then its loud note could be heard from one end of
the village to the other. When it died he gave me the specimen, the
only one I was able to procure. It is a member of the family
Locustid&aelig;, a group intermediate between the Cricket
(Achetid&aelig;) and the Grasshoppers (Acridiid&aelig;). The total
length of the body is two inches and a quarter; when the wings are
closed the insect has an inflated vesicular or bladder-like shape,
owing to the great convexity of the thin but firm parchmenty
wing-cases, and the colour is wholly pale-green. The instrument by
which the Tanana produces its music is curiously contrived out of
the ordinary nervures of the wing-cases. In each wing-case the
inner edge, near its origin, has a horny expansion or lobe; on one
wing (<i>b</i>) this lobe has sharp raised margins; on the other
(<i>a</i>), the strong nervure which traverses the lobe on the
under side is crossed by a number of fine sharp furrows like those
of a file. When the insect rapidly moves its wings, the file of the
one lobe is scraped sharply across the horny margin of the other,
thus producing the sounds; the parchmenty wing-cases and the hollow
drum-like space which they enclose assist in giving resonance to
the tones. The projecting portions of both wing-cases are traversed
by a similar strong nervure, but this is scored like a file only in
one of them, in the other remaining perfectly smooth. Other species
of the family to which the Tanan&aacute; belongs have similar
stridulating organs, but in none are these so highly developed as
in this insect; they exist always in the males only, the other sex
having the edges of the wing-cases quite straight and simple. The
mode of producing the sounds and their object have been
investigated by several authors with regard to certain European
species. They are the call-notes of the males. In the common
field-cricket of Europe the male has been observed to place itself,
in the evening, at the entrance of its burrow, and stridulate until
a female approaches, when the louder notes are succeeded by a more
subdued tone, whilst the successful musician caresses with his
antenn&aelig; the mate he has won. Anyone who will take the trouble
may observe a similar proceeding in the common house-cricket. The
nature and object of this insect music are more uniform than the
structure and situation of the instrument by which it is produced.
This differs in each of the three allied families above mentioned.
In the crickets the wing-cases are symmetrical; both have straight
edges and sharply-scored nervures adapted to produce the
stridulation. A distinct portion of their edges is not, therefore,
set apart for the elaboration of a sound-producing instrument. In
this family the wing-cases lie flat on the back of the insect, and
overlap each other for a considerable portion of their extent. In
the Locustid&aelig; the same members have a sloping position on
each side of the body, and do not overlap, except to a small extent
near their bases; it is out of this small portion that the
stridulating organ is contrived. Greater resonance is given in most
species by a thin transparent plate, covered by a membrane, in the
centre of the overlapping lobes. In the Grasshoppers
(Acridiid&aelig;) the wing-cases meet in a straight suture, and the
friction of portions of their edges is no longer possible. But
Nature exhibits the same fertility of resource here as elsewhere;
and in contriving other methods of supplying the males with an
instrument for the production of call-notes indicates the great
importance which she attaches to this function. The music in the
males of the Acridiid&aelig; is produced by the scraping of the
long hind thighs against the horny nervures of the outer edges of
the wing-cases; a drum-shaped organ placed in a cavity near the
insertion of the thighs being adapted to give resonance to the
tones.</p>

<p>I obtained very few birds at Obydos. There was no scarcity of
birds, but they were mostly common Cayenne species. In early
morning, the woods near my house were quite animated with their
songs&mdash;an unusual thing in this country. I heard here for the
first time the pleasing wild notes of the Carashue, a species of
thrush, probably the Mimus lividus of ornithologists. I found it
afterwards to be a common bird in the scattered woods of the campo
district near Santarem. It is a much smaller and plainer-coloured
bird than our thrush, and its song is not so loud, varied, or so
long sustained; but the tone is of a sweet and plaintive quality,
which harmonises well with the wild and silent woodlands, where
alone it is heard in the mornings and evenings of sultry tropical
days. In course of time the song of this humble thrush stirred up
pleasing associations in my mind, in the same way as those of its
more highly endowed sisters formerly did at home. There are several
allied species in Brazil; in the southern provinces they are called
Sabiahs. The Brazilians are not insensible to the charms of this
their best songster, for I often heard some pretty verses in praise
of the Sabiah sung by young people to the accompaniment of the
guitar. I found several times the nest of the Carashu&eacute;,
which is built of dried grass and slender twigs, and lined with
mud; the eggs are coloured and spotted like those of our blackbird,
but they are considerably smaller. I was much pleased with a
brilliant little red-headed mannikin, which I shot here (Pipra
cornuta). There were three males seated on a low branch, and
hopping slowly backwards and forwards, near to one another, as
though engaged in a kind of dance. In the pleasant airy woods
surrounding the sandy shores of the pool behind the town, the
yellow-bellied Trogon (T. viridis) was very common. Its back is of
a brilliant metallic-green colour, and the breast steel blue. The
natives call it the Suruqu&aacute; do Ygap&oacute;, or Trogon of
the flooded lands, in contradistinction to the red-breasted
species, which are named Surtiqu&aacute;s da terra firma. I often
saw small companies of half a dozen individuals quietly seated on
the lower branches of trees. They remained almost motionless for an
hour or two at a time, simply moving their heads, on the watch for
passing insects; or, as seemed more generally to be the case,
scanning the neighbouring trees for fruit, which they darted off
now and then, at long intervals, to secure, returning always to the
same perch.</p>

<br>
<p class="fnote"><a name="1">1.</a> It was during this voyage that
the nation of female warriors was said to have been met with; a
report which gave rise to the Portuguese name of the river,
Amazonas. It is now pretty well known that this is a mere fable,
originating in the love of the marvellous which distinguished the
early Spanish adventurers, and impaired the credibility of their
narratives.<br>

of Texeira&rsquo;s expedition, who accompanied him, in 1639, on his
