<br>
<p class="first">I have already given a short account of the size,
situation, and general appearance of Santarem. Although containing
not more than 2500 inhabitants, it is the most civilised and
important settlement on the banks of the main river from Peru to
the Atlantic. The pretty little town, or city as it is called, with
its rows of tolerably uniform, white-washed and red-tiled houses
surrounded by green gardens and woods, stands on gently sloping
ground on the eastern side of the Tapajos, close to its point of
junction with the Amazons. A small eminence on which a fort has
been erected, but which is now in a dilapidated condition,
overlooks the streets, and forms the eastern limit of the mouth of
the tributary. The Tapajos at Santarem is contracted to a breadth
of about a mile and a half by an accretion of low alluvial land,
which forms a kind of delta on the western side; fifteen miles
further up the river is seen at its full width of from ten to a
dozen miles, and the magnificent hilly country, through which it
flows from the south, is then visible on both shores. This high
land, which appears to be a continuation of the central table-lands
of Brazil, stretches almost without interruption on the eastern
side of the river down to its mouth at Santarem. The scenery as
well as the soil, vegetation, and animal tenants of this region,
are widely different from those of the flat and uniform country
which borders the Amazons along most part of its course. After
travelling week after week on the main river, the aspect of
Santarem with its broad white sandy beach, limpid dark-green
waters, and line of picturesque hills rising behind over the fringe
of green forest, affords an agreeable surprise. On the main
Amazons, the prospect is monotonous unless the vessel runs near the
shore, when the wonderful diversity and beauty of the vegetation
afford constant entertainment. Otherwise, the unvaried, broad
yellow stream, and the long low line of forest, which dwindles away
in a broken line of trees on the sea-like horizon and is renewed,
reach after reach, as the voyages advances, weary by their
uniformity.</p>

<p>I arrived at Santarem on my second journey into the interior, in
November, 1851, and made it my head-quarters for a period, as it
turned out, of three years and a half. During this time I made, in
pursuance of the plan I had framed, many excursions up the Tapajos,
and to other places of interest in the surrounding region. On
landing, I found no difficulty in hiring a suitable house on the
outskirts of the place. It was pleasantly situated near the beach,
going towards the aldeia or Indian part of the town. The ground
sloped from the back premises down to the waterside and my little
raised veranda overlooked a beautiful flower-garden, a great rarity
in this country, which belonged to the neighbours. The house
contained only three rooms, one with brick and two with boarded
floors. It was substantially built, like all the better sort of
houses in Santarem, and had a stuccoed front. The kitchen, as is
usual, formed an outhouse placed a few yards distant from the other
rooms. The rent was 12,000 reis, or about twenty-seven shillings a
month. In this country, a tenant has no extra payments to make; the
owners of house property pay a dizimo or tithe, to the
&ldquo;collectoria geral,&rdquo; or general treasury, but with this
the occupier of course has nothing to do. In engaging servants, I
had the good fortune to meet with a free mulatto, an industrious
and trustworthy young fellow, named Jos&eacute;, willing to arrange
with me; the people of his family cooked for us, whilst he assisted
me in collecting; he proved of the greatest service in the
different excursions we subsequently made. Servants of any kind
were almost impossible to be obtained at Santarem, free people
being too proud to hire themselves, and slaves too few and valuable
to their masters to be let out to others. These matters arranged,
the house put in order, and a rude table, with a few chairs, bought
or borrowed to furnish the house with, I was ready in three or four
days to commence my Natural History explorations in the
neighbourhood.</p>

<br>
<p>I found Santarem quite a different sort of place from the other
settlements on the Amazons. At Camet&aacute;, the lively,
good-humoured, and plain-living Mamelucos formed the bulk of the
population, the white immigrants there, as on the Rio Negro and
Upper Amazons, seeming to have fraternised well with the
aborigines. In the neighbourhood of Santarem the Indians, I
believe, were originally hostile to the Portuguese; at any rate,
the blending of the two races has not been here on a large scale. I
did not find the inhabitants the pleasant, easy-going, and
blunt-spoken country folk that are met with in other small towns of
the interior. The whites, Portuguese and Brazilians, are a
relatively more numerous class here than in other settlements, and
make great pretensions to civilisation; they are the merchants and
shopkeepers of the place; owners of slaves, cattle estates, and
cacao plantations. Amongst the principal residents must also be
mentioned the civil and military authorities, who are generally
well-bred and intelligent people from other provinces. Few Indians
live in the place; it is too civilised for them, and the lower
class is made up (besides the few slaves) of half-breeds, in whose
composition negro blood predominates. Coloured people also exercise
the different handicrafts; the town supports two goldsmiths, who
are mulattoes, and have each several apprentices; the blacksmiths
are chiefly Indians, as is the case generally throughout the
province. The manners of the upper class (copied from those of
Par&aacute;) are very stiff and formal, and the absence of the
hearty hospitality met with in other places, produces a
disagreeable impression at first. Much ceremony is observed in the
intercourse of the principal people with each other, and with
strangers. The best room in each house is set apart for receptions,
and visitors are expected to present themselves in black dress
coats, regardless of the furious heat which rages in the sandy
streets of Santarem towards mid-day, the hour when visits are
generally made. In the room a cane-bottomed sofa and chairs, all
lacquered and gilded, are arranged in quadrangular form, and here
the visitors are invited to seat themselves, whilst the compliments
are passed, or the business arranged. In taking leave, the host
backs out his guests with repeated bows, finishing at the front
door. Smoking is not in vogue amongst this class, but snuff-taking
is largely indulged in, and great luxury is displayed in gold and
silver snuff-boxes. All the gentlemen, and indeed most of the
ladies also, wear gold watches and guard chains. Social parties are
not very frequent; the principal men being fully occupied with
their business and families, and the rest spending their leisure in
billiard and gambling rooms, leaving wives and daughters shut up at
home. Occasionally, however, one of the principal citizens gives a
ball. In the first that I attended, the gentlemen were seated all
the evening on one side of the room, and the ladies on the other,
and partners were allotted by means of numbered cards, distributed
by a master of the ceremonies. But the customs changed rapidly in
these matters after steamers began to run on the Amazons (in 1853),
bringing a flood of new ideas and fashions into the country. The
old, bigoted, Portuguese system of treating women, which stifled
social intercourse and wrought endless evils in the private life of
the Brazilians, is now being gradually, although slowly,
abandoned.</p>

<p>The religious festivals were not so numerous here as in other
towns, and when they did take place, were very poor and ill
attended. There is a handsome church, but the vicar showed
remarkably little zeal for religion, except for a few days now and
then when the Bishop came from Par&aacute; on his rounds through
the diocese. The people are as fond of holiday-making here as in
other parts of the province; but it seemed to be a growing fashion
to substitute rational amusements for the processions and mummeries
of the saints&rsquo; days. The young folks are very musical, the
principal instruments in use being the flute, violin, Spanish
guitar, and a small four-stringed viola, called cavaquinho. During
the early part of my stay at Santarem, a little party of
instrumentalists, led by a tall, thin, ragged mulatto, who was
quite an enthusiast in his art, used frequently to serenade their
friends in the cool and brilliant moonlit evenings of the dry
season, playing French and Italian marches and dance music with
very good effect. The guitar was the favourite instrument with both
sexes, as at Par&aacute;; the piano, however, is now fast
superseding it. The ballads sung to the accompaniment of the guitar
were not learned from written or printed music, but communicated
orally from one friend to another. They were never spoken of as
songs, but <i>modinhas</i>, or &ldquo;little fashions,&rdquo; each
of which had its day, giving way to the next favourite brought by
some young fellow from the capital. At festival times there was a
great deal of masquerading, in which all the people, old and young,
white, negro, and Indian, took great delight. The best things of
this kind used to come off during the Carnival, in Easter week, and
on St. John&rsquo;s Eve; the negroes having a grand semi-dramatic
display in the streets at Christmas time. The more select affairs
were got up by the young whites, and coloured men associating with
whites. A party of thirty or forty of these used to dress
themselves in uniform style, and in very good taste, as cavaliers
and dames, each disguised with a peculiar kind of light gauze mask.
The troop, with a party of musicians, went the round of their
friends&rsquo; houses in the evening, and treated the large and
gaily-dressed companies which were there assembled to a variety of
dances. The principal citizens, in the large rooms of whose houses
these entertainments were given, seemed quite to enjoy them; great
preparations were made at each place; and, after the dance, guests
and masqueraders were regaled with pale ale and sweetmeats. Once a
year the Indians, with whom masked dances and acting are
indigenous, had their turn, and on one occasion they gave us a
great treat. They assembled from different parts of the
neighbourhood at night, on the outskirts of the town, and then
marched through the streets by torchlight towards the quarter
inhabited by the whites, to perform their hunting and devil dances
before the doors of the principal inhabitants. There were about a
hundred men, women, and children in the procession. Many of the men
were dressed in the magnificent feather crowns, tunics, and belts,
manufactured by the Munduruc&uacute;s, and worn by them on festive
occasions, but the women were naked to the waist, and the children
quite naked, and all were painted and smeared red with anatto. The
ringleader enacted the part of the Tushaua, or chief, and carried a
sceptre, richly decorated with the orange, red, and green feathers
of toucans and parrots. The paj&eacute; or medicine-man came along,
puffing at a long tauar&iacute; cigar, the instrument by which he
professes to make his wonderful cures. Others blew harsh, jarring
blasts with the tur&eacute;, a horn made of long and thick bamboo,
with a split reed in the mouthpiece. This is the war trumpet of
many tribes of Indians, with which the sentinels of predatory
hordes, mounted on a lofty tree, gave the signal for attack to
their comrades. Those Brazilians who are old enough to remember the
times of warfare between Indians and settlers, retain a great
horror of the tur&eacute;, its loud, harsh note heard in the dead
of the night having been often the prelude to an onslaught of
bloodthirsty M&uacute;ras on the outlying settlements. The rest of
the men in the procession carried bows and arrows, bunches of
javelins, clubs, and paddles. The older children brought with them
the household pets; some had monkeys or coatis on their shoulders,
and others bore tortoises on their heads. The squaws carried their
babies in aturas, or large baskets, slung on their backs, and
secured with a broad belt of bast over their foreheads. The whole
thing was accurate in its representation of Indian life, and showed
more ingenuity than some people give the Brazilian red man credit
for. It was got up spontaneously by the Indians, and simply to
amuse the people of the place.</p>

<p>The people seem to be thoroughly alive to the advantages of
education for their children. Besides the usual primary schools,
one for girls, and another for boys, there is a third of a higher
class, where Latin and French, amongst other accomplishments, are
taught by professors, who, like the common schoolmasters, are paid
by the provincial government. This is used as a preparatory school
to the Lyceum and Bishop&rsquo;s seminary, well-endowed
institutions at Par&aacute;, whither it is the ambition of traders
and planters to send their sons to finish their studies. The
rudiments of education only are taught in the primary schools, and
it is surprising how quickly and well the little lads, both
coloured and white, learn reading, writing, and arithmetic. But the
simplicity of the Portuguese language, which is written as it is
pronounced, or according to unvarying rules, and the use of the
decimal system of accounts, make these acquirements much easier
than they are with us. Students in the superior school have to pass
an examination before they can be admitted at the colleges in
Par&aacute;, and the managers once did me the honour to make me one
of the examiners for the year. The performances of the youths, most
of whom were under fourteen years of age, were very creditable,
especially in grammar; there was a quickness of apprehension
displayed which would have gladdened the heart of a northern
schoolmaster. The course of study followed at the colleges of
Par&aacute; must be very deficient; for it is rare to meet with an
educated Paraense who has the slightest knowledge of the physical
sciences, or even of geography, if he has not travelled out of the
province. The young men all become smart rhetoricians and lawyers;
any of them is ready to plead in a law case at an hour&rsquo;s
notice; they are also great at statistics, for the gratification of
which taste there is ample field in Brazil, where every public
officer has to furnish volumes of dry reports annually to the
government; but they are woefully ignorant on most other subjects.
I do not recollect seeing a map of any kind at Santarem. The
quick-witted people have a suspicion of their deficiencies in this
respect, and it is difficult to draw them out on geography; but one
day a man holding an important office betrayed himself by asking
me, &ldquo;On what side of the river was Paris situated?&rdquo;
This question did not arise, as might be supposed, from a desire
for accurate topographical knowledge of the Seine, but from the
idea, that all the world was a great river, and that the different
places he had heard of must lie on one shore or the other. The fact
of the Amazons being a limited stream, having its origin in narrow
rivulets, its beginning and its ending, has never entered the heads
of most of the people who have passed their whole lives on its
banks.</p>

<p>Santarem is a pleasant place to live in, irrespective of its
society. There are no insect pests, mosquito, pium, sand-fly, or
motuca. The climate is glorious; during six months of the year,
from August to February, very little rain falls, and the sky is
cloudless for weeks together, the fresh breezes from the sea,
nearly 400 miles distant, moderating the great heat of the sun. The
wind is sometimes so strong for days together, that it is difficult
to make way against it in walking along the streets, and it enters
the open windows and doors of houses, scattering loose clothing and
papers in all directions. The place is considered healthy; but at
the changes of season, severe colds and ophthalmia are prevalent. I
found three Englishmen living here, who had resided many years in
the town or its neighbourhood, and who still retained their florid
complexions; the plump and fresh appearance of many of the
middle-aged Santarem ladies also bore testimony to the
healthfulness of the climate. The streets are always clean and dry,
even in the height of the wet season; good order is always kept,
and the place pretty well supplied with provisions. None but those
who have suffered from the difficulty of obtaining the necessities
of life at any price in most of the interior settlements of South
America, can appreciate the advantages of Santarem in this respect.
Everything, however, except meat, was dear, and becoming every year
more so. Sugar, coffee, and rice, which ought to be produced in
surplus in the neighbourhood, are imported from other provinces,
and are high in price; sugar, indeed, is a little dearer here than
in England. There were two or three butchers&rsquo; shops, where
excellent beef could be had daily at twopence or twopence-halfpenny
per pound. The cattle have not to be brought from a long distance
as at Par&aacute;, being bred on the campos, which border the Lago
Grande, only one or two days&rsquo; journey from the town. Fresh
fish could be bought in the port on most evenings, but as the
supply did not equal the demand, there was always a race amongst
purchasers to the waterside when the canoe of a fisherman hove in
sight. Very good bread was hawked round the town every morning,
with milk, and a great variety of fruits and vegetables. Amongst
the fruits, there was a kind called atta, which I did not see in
any other part of the country. It belongs to the Anonaceous order,
and the tree which produces it grows apparently wild in the
neighbourhood of Santarem. It is a little larger than a good-sized
orange, and the rind, which encloses a mass of rich custardy pulp,
is scaled like the pineapple, but green when ripe, and encrusted on
the inside with sugar. To finish this account of the advantages of
Santarem, the delicious bathing in the clear waters of the Tapajos
may be mentioned. There is here no fear of alligators; when the
east wind blows, a long swell rolls in on the clean sandy beach,
and the bath is most exhilarating.</p>

<p>The country around Santarem is not clothed with dense and lofty
forest like the rest of the great humid river plain of the Amazons.
It is a campo region; a slightly elevated and undulating tract of
land, wooded only in patches, or with single scattered trees. A
good deal of the country on the borders of the Tapajos, which flows
from the great campo area of interior Brazil, is of this
description. It is on this account that I consider the eastern side
of the river, towards its mouth, to be a northern prolongation of
the continental land, and not a portion of the alluvial flats of
the Amazons. The soil is a coarse gritty sand; the substratum,
which is visible in some places, consisting of sandstone
conglomerate probably of the same formation as that which underlies
the Tabatinga clay in other parts of the river valley. The surface
is carpeted with slender hairy grasses, unfit for pasture, growing
to a uniform height of about a foot. The patches of wood look like
copses in the middle of green meadows; they are called by the
natives &ldquo;ilhas de mato,&rdquo; or islands of jungle; the name
being, no doubt, suggested by their compactness of outline, neatly
demarcated in insular form from the smooth carpet of grass, around
them. They are composed of a great variety of trees loaded with
succulent parasites, and lashed together by woody climbers like the
forest in other parts. A narrow belt of dense wood, similar in
character to these ilhas, and like them sharply limited along its
borders, runs everywhere parallel and close to the river. In
crossing the campo, the path from the town ascends a little for a
mile or two, passing through this marginal strip of wood; the
grassy land then slopes gradually to a broad valley, watered by
rivulets, whose banks are clothed with lofty and luxuriant forest.
Beyond this, a range of hills extends as far as the eye can reach
towards the yet untrodden interior. Some of these hills are long
ridges, wooded or bare; others are isolated conical peaks, rising
abruptly from the valley. The highest are probably not more than a
thousand feet above the level of the river. One remarkable hill,
the Serra de Muruar&uacute;, about fifteen miles from Santarem,
which terminates the prospect to the south, is of the same
truncated pyramidal form as the range of hills near Almeyrim.
Complete solitude reigns over the whole of this stretch of
beautiful country. The inhabitants of Santarem know nothing of the
interior, and seem to feel little curiosity concerning it. A few
tracks from the town across the campo lead to some small clearings
four or five miles off, belonging to the poorer inhabitants of the
place; but, excepting these, there are no roads, or signs of the
proximity of a civilised settlement.</p>

<p>The appearance of the campos changes very much according to the
season. There is not that grand uniformity of aspect throughout the
year which is observed in the virgin forest, and which makes a
deeper impression on the naturalist the longer he remains in this
country. The seasons in this part of the Amazons region are sharply
contrasted, but the difference is not so great as in some tropical
countries, where, during the dry monsoon, insects and reptiles go
into a summer sleep, and the trees simultaneously shed their
leaves. As the dry season advances (August, September), the grass
on the campos withers, and the shrubby vegetation near the town
becomes a mass of parched yellow stubble. The period, however, is
not one of general torpidity or repose for animal or vegetable
life. Birds certainly are not so numerous as in the wet season, but
some kinds remain and lay their eggs at this time&mdash;for
instance, the ground doves (Cham&aelig;pelia). The trees retain
their verdure throughout, and many of them flower in the dry
months. Lizards do not become torpid, and insects are seen both in
the larva and the perfect states, showing that the aridity of the
climate has not a general influence on the development of the
species. Some kinds of butterflies, especially the little
hairstreaks (Thecl&aelig;), whose caterpillars feed on the trees,
make their appearance only when the dry season is at its height.
The land molluscs of the district are the only animals which
&aelig;stivate; they are found in clusters, Bulimi and Helices,
concealed in hollow trees, the mouths of their shells closed by a
film of mucus. The fine weather breaks up often with great
suddenness about the beginning of February. Violent squalls from
the west or the opposite direction to the trade-wind then occur.
They give very little warning, and the first generally catches the
people unprepared. They fall in the night, and blowing directly
into the harbour, with the first gust sweep all vessels from their
anchorage; in a few minutes a mass of canoes, large and small,
including schooners of fifty tons burthen, are clashing together,
pell-mell, on the beach. I have reason to remember these storms,
for I was once caught in one myself, whilst crossing the river in
an undecked boat about a day&rsquo;s journey from Santarem. They
are accompanied with terrific electric explosions, the sharp claps
of thunder falling almost simultaneously with the blinding flashes
of lightning. Torrents of rain follow the first outbreak; the wind
then gradually abates, and the rain subsides into a steady drizzle,
which continues often for the greater part of the succeeding day.
After a week or two of showery weather, the aspect of the country
is completely changed. The parched ground in the neighbourhood of
Santarem breaks out, so to speak, in a rash of greenery; the dusty,
languishing trees gain, without having shed their old leaves, a new
clothing of tender green foliage; a wonderful variety of
quick-growing leguminous plants springs up; and leafy creepers
overrun the ground, the bushes, and the trunks of trees. One is
reminded of the sudden advent of spring after a few warm showers in
northern climates; I was the more struck by it as nothing similar
is witnessed in the virgin forests amongst which I had passed the
four years previous to my stay in this part. The grass on the
campos is renewed, and many of the campo trees, especially the
myrtles, which grow abundantly in one portion of the district,
begin to flower, attracting by the fragrance of their blossoms a
great number and variety of insects, more particularly Coleoptera.
Many kinds of birds; parrots, toucans, and barbets, which live
habitually in the forest, then visit the open places. A few weeks
of comparatively dry weather generally intervene in March, after a
month or two of rain. The heaviest rains fall in April, May, and
June; they come in a succession of showers, with sunny, gleamy
weather in the intervals. June and July are the months when the
leafy luxuriance of the campos, and the activity of life, are at
their highest. Most birds have then completed their moulting, which
extends over the period from February to May. The flowering shrubs
are then mostly in bloom, and numberless kinds of Dipterous and
Hymenopterous insects appear simultaneously with the flowers. This
season might be considered the equivalent of summer in temperate
climates, as the bursting forth of the foliage in February
represents the spring; but under the equator there is not that
simultaneous march in the annual life of animals and plants, which
we see in high latitudes; some species, it is true, are dependent
upon others in their periodical acts of life, and go hand-in-hand
with them, but they are not all simultaneously and similarly
affected by the physical changes of the seasons.</p>

<br>
<p>I will now give an account of some of my favourite collecting
places in the neighbourhood of Santarem, incorporating with the
description a few of the more interesting observations made on the
Natural History of the localities. To the west of the town there
was a pleasant path along the beach to a little bay, called
Mapir&iacute;, about five miles within the mouth of the Tapajos.
The road was practicable only in the dry season. The river at
Santarem rises on the average about thirty feet, varying in
different years about ten feet, so that in the four months from
April to July, the water comes up to the edge of the marginal belt
of wood already spoken of. This Mapiri excursion was most pleasant
and profitable in the months from January to March, before the
rains became too continuous. The sandy beach beyond the town is
very irregular, in some places forming long spits on which, when
the east wind is blowing, the waves break in a line of foam; at
others, receding to shape out quiet little bays and pools. On the
outskirts of the town a few scattered huts of Indians and coloured
people are passed, prettily situated on the margin of the white
beach, with a background of glorious foliage; the cabin of the
pure-blood Indian being distinguished from the mud hovels of the
free negroes and mulattoes by its light construction, half of it
being an open shed where the dusky tenants are seen at all hours of
the day lounging in their open-meshed grass hammocks. About two
miles on the road we come to a series of shallow pools, called the
Laguinhos, which are connected with the river in the wet season,
but separated from it by a high bank of sand topped with bushes at
other times. There is a break here in the fringe of wood, and a
glimpse is obtained of the grassy campo. When the waters have risen
to the level of the pools, this place is frequented by many kinds
of wading-birds. Snow-white egrets of two species stand about the
margins of the water, and dusky-striped herons may be seen half
hidden under the shade of the bushes. The pools are covered with a
small kind of water-lily, and surrounded by a dense thicket.
Amongst the birds which inhabit this spot is the rosy-breasted
Troupial (Trupialis Gulanensis), a bird resembling our starling in
size and habits, and not unlike it in colour, with the exception of
the rich rosy vest. The water at this time of the year overflows a
large level tract of campo bordering the pools, and the Troupials
come to feed on the larv&aelig; of insects which then abound in the
moist soil.</p>

<p>Beyond the Laguinhos there succeeds a tract of level beach
covered with trees which form a beautiful grove. About the month of
April, when the water rises to this level, the trees are covered
with blossom, and a handsome orchid, an Epidendron with large white
flowers, which clothes thickly the trunks, is profusely in bloom.
Several kinds of kingfisher resort to the place. Four species may
be seen within a small space: the largest as big as a crow, of a
mottled-grey hue, and with an enormous beak; the smallest not
larger than a sparrow. The large one makes its nest in clay cliffs,
three or four miles distant from this place. None of the
kingfishers are so brilliant in colour as our English species. The
blossoms on the trees attract two or three species of hummingbirds,
the most conspicuous of which is a large swallow-tailed kind
(Eupetomena macroura), with a brilliant livery of emerald green and
steel blue. I noticed that it did not remain so long poised in the
air before the flowers as the other smaller species; it perched
more frequently, and sometimes darted after small insects on the
wing. Emerging from the grove there is a long stretch of sandy
beach; the land is high and rocky, and the belt of wood which
skirts the river banks is much broader than it is elsewhere. At
length, after rounding a projecting bluff, the bay at Mapir&iacute;
is reached. The river view is characteristic of the Tapajos; the
shores are wooded, and on the opposite side is a line of clay
cliffs with hills in the background clothed with a rolling forest.
A long spit of sand extends into mid-river, beyond which is an
immense expanse of dark water, the further shore of the Tapajos
being barely visible as a thin grey line of trees on the horizon.
The transparency of air and water in the dry season when the brisk
east wind is blowing, and the sharpness of outline of hills, woods,
and sandy beaches, give a great charm to this spot.</p>

<br>
<p>Whilst resting in the shade during the great heat of the early
hours of afternoon, I used to find amusement in watching the
proceedings of the sand wasps. A small pale green kind of Bembex
(Bembex ciliata), was plentiful near the bay of Mapir&iacute;. When
they are at work, a number of little jets of sand are seen shooting
over the surface of the sloping bank. The little miners excavate
with their forefeet, which are strongly built and furnished with a
fringe of stiff bristles; they work with wonderful rapidity, and
the sand thrown out beneath their bodies issues in continuous
streams. They are solitary wasps, each female working on her own
account. After making a gallery two or three inches in length in a
slanting direction from the surface, the owner backs out and takes
a few turns round the orifice apparently to see whether it is well
made, but in reality, I believe, to take note of the locality, that
she may find it again. This done, the busy workwoman flies away;
but returns, after an absence varying in different cases from a few
minutes to an hour or more, with a fly in her grasp, with which she
re-enters her mine. On again emerging, the entrance is carefully
closed with sand. During this interval she has laid an egg on the
body of the fly which she had previously benumbed with her sting,
and which is to serve as food for the soft, footless grub soon to
be hatched from the egg. From what I could make out, the Bembex
makes a fresh excavation for every egg to be deposited; at least in
two or three of the galleries which I opened there was only one fly
enclosed.</p>

<p>I have said that the Bembex on leaving her mine took note of the
locality; this seemed to be the explanation of the short delay
previous to her taking flight; on rising in the air also the
insects generally flew round over the place before making straight
off. Another nearly allied but much larger species, the Monedula
signata, whose habits I observed on the banks of the Upper Amazons,
sometimes excavates its mine solitarily on sand-banks recently laid
bare in the middle of the river, and closes the orifice before
going in search of prey. In these cases the insect has to make a
journey of at least half a mile to procure the kind of fly, the
Mot&uacute;ca (Hadrus lepidotus), with which it provisions its
cell. I often noticed it to take a few turns in the air round the
place before starting; on its return it made without hesitation
straight for the closed mouth of the mine. I was convinced that the
insects noted the bearings of their nests and the direction they
took in flying from them. The proceeding in this and similar cases
(I have read of something analogous having been noticed in hive
bees) seems to be a mental act of the same nature as that which
takes place in ourselves when recognising a locality. The senses,
however, must be immeasurably more keen and the mental operation
much more certain in them than it is in man, for to my eye there
was absolutely no landmark on the even surface of sand which could
serve as guide, and the borders of the forest were not nearer than
half a mile. The action of the wasp would be said to be
instinctive; but it seems plain that the instinct is no mysterious
and unintelligible agent, but a mental process in each individual,
differing from the same in man only by its unerring certainty. The
mind of the insect appears to be so constituted that the impression
of external objects or the want felt, causes it to act with a
precision which seems to us like that of a machine constructed to
move in a certain given way. I have noticed in Indian boys a sense
of locality almost as keen as that possessed by the sand-wasp. An
old Portuguese and myself, accompanied by a young lad about ten
years of age, were once lost in the forest in a most solitary place
on the banks of the main river. Our case seemed hopeless, and it
did not for some time occur to us to consult our little companion,
who had been playing with his bow and arrow all the way whilst we
were hunting, apparently taking no note of the route. When asked,
however, he pointed out, in a moment, the right direction of our
canoe. He could not explain how he knew; I believe he had noted the
course we had taken almost unconsciously; the sense of locality in
his case seemed instinctive.</p>

<p>The Monedula signata is a good friend to travellers in those
parts of the Amazons which are infested by the blood-thirsty
Mot&uacute;ca. I first noticed its habit of preying on this fly one
day when we landed to make our fire and dine on the borders of the
forest adjoining a sand-bank. The insect is as large as a hornet,
and has a most waspish appearance. I was rather startled when one
out of the flock which was hovering about us flew straight at my
face: it had espied a Motuca on my neck and was thus pouncing upon
it. It seizes the fly not with its jaws, but with its fore and
middle feet, and carries it off tightly held to its breast.
Wherever the traveller lands on the Upper Amazons in the
neighbourhood of a sand-bank he is sure to be attended by one or
more of these useful vermin-killers.</p>

<br>
<p>The bay of Mapir&iacute; was the limit of my day excursions by
the river-side to the west of Santarem. A person may travel,
however, on foot, as Indians frequently do, in the dry season for
fifty or sixty miles along the broad clean sandy beaches of the
Tapajos. The only obstacles are the rivulets, most of which are
fordable when the waters are low. To the east my rambles extended
to the banks of the Mahic&aacute; inlet. This enters the Amazons
about three miles below Santarem, where the clear stream of the
Tapajos begins to be discoloured by the turbid waters of the main
river. The Mahic&aacute; has a broad margin of rich level pasture,
limited on each side by the straight, tall hedge of forest. On the
Santarem side it is skirted by high wooded ridges. A landscape of
this description always produced in me an impression of sadness and
loneliness which the luxuriant virgin forests that closely hedge in
most of the by-waters of the Amazons never created. The pastures
are destitute of flowers, and also of animal life, with the
exception of a few small plain-coloured birds and solitary
Carac&aacute;ra eagles whining from the topmost branches of dead
trees on the forest borders. A few settlers have built their palm-
thatched and mud-walled huts on the banks of the Mahic&aacute;, and
occupy themselves chiefly in tending small herds of cattle. They
seemed to be all wretchedly poor. The oxen however, though small,
were sleek and fat, and the district most promising for
agricultural and pastoral employments. In the wet season the waters
gradually rise and cover the meadows, but there is plenty of room
for the removal of the cattle to higher ground. The lazy and
ignorant people seem totally unable to profit by these advantages.
The houses have no gardens or plantations near them. I was told it
was useless to plant anything, because the cattle devoured the
young shoots. In this country, grazing and planting are very rarely
carried on together, for the people seem to have no notion of
enclosing patches of ground for cultivation. They say it is too
much trouble to make enclosures. The construction of a durable
fence is certainly a difficult matter, for it is only two or three
kinds of tree which will serve the purpose in being free from the
attacks of insects, and these are scattered far and wide through
the woods.</p>

<p>Although the meadows were unproductive ground to a naturalist,
the woods on their borders teemed with life; the number and variety
of curious insects of all orders which occurred here was quite
wonderful. The belt of forest was intersected by numerous pathways
leading from one settler&rsquo;s house to another. The ground was
moist, but the trees were not so lofty or their crowns so densely
packed together as in other parts; the sun&rsquo;s light and heat,
therefore, had freer access to the soil, and the underwood was much
more diversified than in the virgin forest. I never saw so many
kinds of dwarf palms together as here; pretty miniature species;
some not more than five feet high, and bearing little clusters of
round fruit not larger than a good bunch of currants. A few of the
forest trees had the size and strongly-branched figures of our
oaks, and a similar bark. One noble palm grew here in great
abundance, and gave a distinctive character to the district. This
was the &OElig;nocarpus distichus, one of the kinds called
Bac&aacute;ba by the natives. It grows to a height of forty to
fifty feet. The crown is of a lustrous dark-green colour, and of a
singularly flattened or compressed shape, the leaves being arranged
on each side in nearly the same plane. When I first saw this tree
on the campos, where the east wind blows with great force night and
day for several months, I thought the shape of the crown was due to
the leaves being prevented from radiating equally by the constant
action of the breezes. But the plane of growth is not always in the
direction of the wind, and the crown has the same shape when the
tree grows in the sheltered woods. The fruit of this fine palm
ripens towards the end of the year, and is much esteemed by the
natives, who manufacture a pleasant drink from it similar to the
assai described in a former chapter, by rubbing off the coat of
pulp from the nuts, and mixing it with water. A bunch of fruit
weighs thirty or forty pounds. The beverage has a milky appearance,
and an agreeable nutty flavour. The tree is very difficult to
climb, on account of the smoothness of its stem; consequently the
natives, whenever they want a bunch of fruit for a bowl of
Bac&aacute;ba, cut down and thus destroy a tree which has taken a
score or two of years to grow, in order to get at it.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the Mahic&aacute; woods, towards the river,
there is a bed of stiff white clay, which supplies the people of
Santarem with material for the manufacture of coarse pottery and
cooking utensils: all the kettles, saucepans, mandioca ovens,
coffee-pots, washing-vessels, and so forth, of the poorer classes,
throughout the country, are made of this same plastic clay, which
occurs at short intervals over the whole surface of the Amazons
valley, from the neighbourhood of Par&aacute; to within the
Peruvian borders, and forms part of the great Tabatinga marl
deposit. To enable the vessels to stand the fire, the bark of a
certain tree, called Caraip&eacute;, is burned and mixed with the
clay, which gives tenacity to the ware. Caraip&eacute; is an
article of commerce, being sold, packed in baskets, at the shops in
most of the towns. The shallow pits, excavated in the marly soil at
Mahic&aacute;, were very attractive to many kinds of mason bees and
wasps, who made use of the clay to build their nests with. So we
have here another example of the curious analogy that exists
between the arts of insects and those of man. I spent many an hour
watching their proceedings; a short account of the habits of some
of these busy creatures may be interesting.</p>

<img src="images/fig17.jpg" width="154" height="263" alt=
"Pelop&aelig;us Wasp building nest." align="left">
<p>The most conspicuous was a large yellow and black wasp, with a
remarkably long and narrow waist, the Pelop&aelig;us fistularis.
This species collected the clay in little round pellets, which it
carried off, after rolling them into a convenient shape, in its
mouth. It came straight to the pit with a loud hum, and, on
alighting, lost not a moment in beginning to work; finishing the
kneading of its little load in two or three minutes. The nest of
this wasp is shaped like a pouch, two inches in length, and is
attached to a branch or other projecting object. One of these
restless artificers once began to build on the handle of a chest in
the cabin of my canoe, when we were stationary at a place for
several days. It was so intent on its work that it allowed me to
inspect the movements of its mouth with a lens whilst it was laying
on the mortar. Every fresh pellet was brought in with a triumphant
song, which changed to a cheerful busy hum when it alighted and
began to work. The little ball of moist clay was laid on the edge
of the cell, and then spread out around the circular rim by means
of the lower lip guided by the mandibles. The insect placed itself
astride over the rim to work, and, on finishing each addition to
the structure, took a turn round, patting the sides with its feet
inside and out before flying off to gather a fresh pellet. It
worked only in sunny weather, and the previous layer was sometimes
not quite dry when the new coating was added. The whole structure
takes about a week to complete. I left the place before the gay
little builder had quite finished her task; she did not accompany
the canoe, although we moved along the bank of the river very
slowly. On opening closed nests of this species, which are common
in the neighbourhood of Mahic&aacute;, I always found them to be
stocked with small spiders of the genus Gastracantha, in the usual
half-dead state to which the mother wasps reduce the insects which
are to serve as food for their progeny.</p>

<img src="images/fig18.jpg" width="207" height="94" alt=
"Cells of Trypoxylon aurifrons." align="right">
<p>Besides the Pelop&aelig;us, there were three or four kinds of
Trypoxylon, a genus also found in Europe, and which some
naturalists have supposed to be parasitic, because the legs are not
furnished with the usual row of strong bristles for digging,
characteristic of the family to which it belongs. The species of
Trypoxylon, however, are all building wasps; two of them which I
observed (T. albitarse and an undescribed species) provision their
nests with spiders, a third (T. aurifrons) with small caterpillars.
Their habits are similar to those of the Pelop&aelig;us; namely,
they carry off the clay in their mandibles, and have a different
song when they hasten away with the burden to that which they sing
whilst at work. Trypoxylon albitarse, which is a large black kind,
three-quarters of an inch in length, makes a tremendous fuss whilst
building its cell. It often chooses the walls or doors of chambers
for this purpose, and when two or three are at work in the same
place, their loud humming keeps the house in an uproar. The cell is
a tubular structure about three inches in length. T. aurifrons, a
much smaller species, makes a neat little nest shaped like a
carafe, building rows of them together in the corners of
verandahs.</p>

<p>But the most numerous and interesting of the clay artificers are
the workers of a species of social bee, the Melipona fasciculata.
The Melipon&aelig; in tropical America take the place of the true
Apides, to which the European hive-bee belongs, and which are here
unknown; they are generally much smaller insects than the hive-bees
and have no sting. The M. fasciculata is about a third shorter than
the Apis mellifica: its colonies are composed of an immense number
of individuals; the workers are generally seen collecting pollen in
the same way as other bees, but great numbers are employed
gathering clay. The rapidity and precision of their movements
whilst thus engaged are wonderful. They first scrape the clay with
their jaws; the small portions gathered are then cleared by the
anterior paws and passed to the second pair of feet, which, in
their turn, convey them to the large foliated expansions of the
hind shanks which are adapted normally in bees, as every one knows,
for the collection of pollen. The middle feet pat the growing
pellets of mortar on the hind legs to keep them in a compact shape
as the particles are successively added. The little hodsmen soon
have as much as they can carry, and they then fly off. I was for
some time puzzled to know what the bees did with the clay; but I
had afterwards plenty of opportunity for ascertaining. They
construct their combs in any suitable crevice in trunks of trees or
perpendicular banks, and the clay is required to build up a wall so
as to close the gap, with the exception of a small orifice for
their own entrance and exit. Most kinds of Melipon&aelig; are in
this way masons as well as workers in wax, and pollen-gatherers.
One little species (undescribed) not more than two lines long,
builds a neat tubular gallery of clay, kneaded with some viscid
substance, outside the entrance to its hive, besides blocking up
the crevice in the tree within which it is situated. The mouth of
the tube is trumpet-shaped, and at the entrance a number of pigmy
bees are always stationed, apparently acting as the sentinels.</p>

<br>


<center><img src="images/fig19.jpg" width="349" height="168" alt=
"Melipona Bees gathering clay."></center>

<p>A hive of the Melipona fasciculata, which I saw opened,
contained about two quarts of pleasant-tasting liquid honey. The
bees, as already remarked, have no sting, but they bite furiously
when their colonies are disturbed. The Indian who plundered the
hive was completely covered by them; they took a particular fancy
to the hair of his head, and fastened on it by hundreds. I found
forty-five species of these bees in different parts of the country;
the largest was half an inch in length; the smallest were extremely
minute, some kinds being not more than one-twelfth of an inch in
size. These tiny fellows are often very troublesome in the woods,
on account of their familiarity, for they settle on one&rsquo;s
face and hands, and, in crawling about, get into the eyes and
mouth, or up the nostrils.</p>

<p>The broad expansion of the hind shanks of bees is applied in
some species to other uses besides the conveyance of clay and
pollen. The female of the handsome golden and black Euglossa
Surinamensis has this palette of very large size. This species
builds its solitary nest also in crevices of walls or trees; but it
closes up the chink with fragments of dried leaves and sticks
cemented together, instead of clay. It visits the caju trees, and
gathers with its hind legs a small quantity of the gum which exudes
from their trunks. To this it adds the other materials required
from the neighbouring bushes, and when laden flies off to its
nest.</p>

<br>
<p>To the south my rambles never extended further than the banks of
the Irur&aacute;, a stream which rises amongst the hills already
spoken of, and running through a broad valley, wooded along the
margins of the water-courses, falls into the Tapajos, at the head
of the bay of Mapir&iacute;. All beyond, as before remarked, is
terra incognita to the inhabitants of Santarem. The Brazilian
settlers on the banks of the Amazons seem to have no taste for
explorations by land, and I could find no person willing to
accompany me on an excursion further towards the interior. Such a
journey would be exceedingly difficult in this country, even if men
could be obtained willing to undertake it. Besides, there were
reports of a settlement of fierce runaway negroes on the Serra de
Mururar&uacute;, and it was considered unsafe to go far in that
direction, except with a large armed party.</p>

<p>I visited the banks of the Irur&aacute; and the rich woods
accompanying it, and two other streams in the same neighbourhood,
one called the Pan&eacute;ma, and the other the Urumar&iacute;,
once or twice a week during the whole time of my residence in
Santarem, and made large collections of their natural productions.
These forest brooks, with their clear, cold waters brawling over
their sandy or pebbly beds through wild tropical glens, always had
a great charm for me. The beauty of the moist, cool, and luxuriant
glades was heightened by the contrast they afforded to the sterile
country around them. The bare or scantily wooded hills which
surround the valley are parched by the rays of the vertical sun.
One of them, the Pico do Irura, forms a nearly perfect cone, rising
from a small grassy plain to a height of 500 or 600 feet, and its
ascent is excessively fatiguing after the long walk from Santarem
over the campos. I tried it one day, but did not reach the summit.
A dense growth of coarse grasses clothed the steep sides of the
hill, with here and there a stunted tree of kinds found in the
plain beneath. In bared places, a red crumbly soil is exposed; and
in one part a mass of rock, which appeared to me, from its compact
texture and the absence of stratification, to be porphyritic; but I
am not geologically sufficient to pronounce on such questions. Mr.
Wallace states that he found fragments of scori&aelig;, and
believes the hill to be a volcanic cone. To the south and east of
this isolated peak, the elongated ridges or table-topped hills
attain a somewhat greater elevation.</p>

<p>The forest in the valley is limited to a tract a few hundred
yards in width on each side the different streams; in places where
these run along the bases of the hills, the hill-sides facing the
water are also richly wooded, although their opposite declivities
are bare or nearly so. The trees are lofty and of great variety;
amongst them are colossal examples of the Brazil nut tree
(Bertholletia excelsa), and the Piki&aacute;. This latter bears a
large eatable fruit, curious in having a hollow chamber between the
pulp and the kernel, beset with hard spines which produce serious
wounds if they enter the skin. The eatable part appeared to me not
much more palatable than a raw potato; but the inhabitants of
Santarem are very fond of it, and undertake the most toilsome
journeys on foot to gather a basketful. The tree which yields the
tonka bean (Dipteryx odorata), used in Europe for scenting snuff,
is also of frequent occurrence here. It grows to an immense height,
and the fruit, which, although a legume, is of a rounded shape, and
has but one seed, can be gathered only when it falls to the ground.
A considerable quantity (from 1000 to 3000 pounds) is exported
annually from Santarem, the produce of the whole region of the
Tapajos. An endless diversity of trees and shrubs, some beautiful
in flower and foliage, others bearing curious fruits, grow in this
matted wilderness. It would be tedious to enumerate many of them. I
was much struck with the variety of trees with large and
diversely-shaped fruits growing out of the trunk and branches, some
within a few inches of the ground, like the cacao. Most of them are
called by the natives Cup&uacute;, and the trees are of
inconsiderable height. One of them called Cup&uacute;-a&iuml; bears
a fruit of elliptical shape and of a dingy earthen colour six or
seven inches long, the shell of which is woody and thin, and
contains a small number of seeds loosely enveloped in a juicy pulp
of very pleasant flavour. The fruits hang like clayey
ants&rsquo;-nests from the branches. Another kind more nearly
resembles the cacao; this is shaped something like the cucumber,
and has a green ribbed husk. It bears the name of Cacao de macaco,
or monkey&rsquo;s chocolate, but the seeds are smaller than those
of the common cacao. I tried once or twice to make chocolate from
them. They contain plenty of oil of similar fragrance to that of
the ordinary cacao-nut, and make up very well into paste; but the
beverage has a repulsive clayey colour and an inferior flavour.</p>

<p>My excursions to the Irur&aacute; had always a picnic character.
A few rude huts are scattered through the valley, but they are
tenanted only for a few days in the year, when their owners come to
gather and roast the mandioca of their small clearings. We used
generally to take with us two boys&mdash;one negro, the other
Indian&mdash;to carry our provisions for the day; a few pounds of
beef or dried fish, farinha and bananas, with plates, and a kettle
for cooking. Jos&eacute; carried the guns, ammunition and
game-bags, and I the apparatus for entomologising&mdash;the insect
net, a large leathern bag with compartments for corked boxes,
phials, glass tubes, and so forth. It was our custom to start soon
after sunrise, when the walk over the campos was cool and pleasant,
the sky without a cloud, and the grass wet with dew. The paths are
mere faint tracks; in our early excursions it was difficult to
avoid missing our way. We were once completely lost, and wandered
about for several hours over the scorching soil without recovering
the road. A fine view is obtained of the country from the rising
ground about half way across the waste. Thence to the bottom of the
valley is a long, gentle, grassy slope, bare of trees. The
strangely-shaped hills; the forest at their feet, richly varied
with palms; the bay of Mapir&iacute; on the right, with the dark
waters of the Tapajos and its white glistening shores, are all
spread out before one, as if depicted on canvas. The extreme
transparency of the atmosphere gives to all parts of the landscape
such clearness of outline that the idea of distance is destroyed,
and one fancies the whole to be almost within reach of the hand.
Descending into the valley, a small brook has to be crossed, and
then half a mile of sandy plain, whose vegetation wears a peculiar
aspect, owing to the predominance of a stemless palm, the
Curu&aacute; (Attalea spectabilis), whose large, beautifully
pinnated, rigid leaves rise directly from the soil. The fruit of
this species is similar to the coco-nut, containing milk in the
interior of the kernel, but it is much inferior to it in size.
Here, and indeed all along the road, we saw, on most days in the
wet season, tracks of the jaguar. We never, however, met with the
animal, although we sometimes heard his loud &ldquo;hough&rdquo; in
the night whilst lying in our hammocks at home, in Santarem, and
knew he must he lurking somewhere near us.</p>

<br>


<center><img src="images/fig20.jpg" width="370" height="197" alt=
"The Jacuaru (Teius teguexim)."></center>

<p>My best hunting ground was a part of the valley sheltered on one
side by a steep hill whose declivity, like the swampy valley
beneath, was clothed with magnificent forest. We used to make our
halt in a small cleared place, tolerably free from ants and close
to the water. Here we assembled after our toilsome morning&rsquo;s
hunt in different directions through the woods, took our
well-earned meal on the ground&mdash;two broad leaves of the wild
banana serving us for a tablecloth&mdash;and rested for a couple of
hours during the great heat of the afternoon. The diversity of
animal productions was as wonderful as that of the vegetable forms
in this rich locality. It was pleasant to lie down during the
hottest part of the day, when my people lay asleep, and watch the
movements of animals. Sometimes a troop of An&uacute;s
(Crotophaga), a glossy black-plumaged bird, which lives in small
societies in grassy places, would come in from the campos, one by
one, calling to each other as they moved from tree to tree. Or a
Toucan (Rhamphastos ariel) silently hopped or ran along and up the
branches, peeping into chinks and crevices. Notes of solitary birds
resounded from a distance through the wilderness. Occasionally a
sulky Trogon would be seen, with its brilliant green back and
rose-coloured breast, perched for an hour without moving on a low
branch. A number of large, fat lizards two feet long, of a kind
called by the natives Jacuar&uacute; (Teius teguexim) were always
observed in the still hours of midday scampering with great clatter
over the dead leaves, apparently in chase of each other. The fat of
this bulky lizard is much prized by the natives, who apply it as a
poultice to draw palm spines or even grains of shot from the flesh.
Other lizards of repulsive aspect, about three feet in length when
full grown, splashed about and swam in the water, sometimes
emerging to crawl into hollow trees on the banks of the stream,
where I once found a female and a nest of eggs. The lazy flapping
flight of large blue and black morpho butterflies high in the air,
the hum of insects, and many inanimate sounds, contributed their
share to the total impression this strange solitude produced. Heavy
fruits from the crowns of trees which were mingled together at a
giddy height overhead, fell now and then with a startling
&ldquo;plop&rdquo; into the water. The breeze, not felt below,
stirred in the topmost branches, setting the twisted and looped
sip&oacute;s in motion, which creaked and groaned in a great
variety of notes. To these noises were added the monotonous ripple
of the brook, which had its little cascade at every score or two
yards of its course.</p>

<p>We frequently fell in with an old Indian woman, named Cecilia,
who had a small clearing in the woods. She had the reputation of
being a witch (feiticeira), and I found, on talking with her, that
she prided herself on her knowledge of the black art. Her slightly
curled hair showed that she was not a pure-blood Indian: I was told
her father was a dark mulatto. She was always very civil to our
party, showing us the best paths, explaining the virtues and uses
of different plants, and so forth. I was much amused at the
accounts she gave of the place. Her solitary life and the gloom of
the woods seemed to have filled her with superstitious fancies. She
said gold was contained in the bed of the brook, and that the
murmur of the water over the little cascades was the voice of the
&ldquo;water-mother&rdquo; revealing the hidden treasure. A narrow
pass between two hillsides was the portao or gate, and all within,
along the wooded banks of the stream, was enchanted ground. The
hill underneath which we were encamped was the enchanter&rsquo;s
abode, and she gravely told us she often had long conversations
with him. These myths were of her own invention, and in the same
way an endless number of other similar ones have originated in the
childish imaginations of the poor Indian and half-breed inhabitants
of different parts of the country. It is to be remarked, however,
that the Indian men all become sceptics after a little intercourse
with the whites. The witchcraft of poor Cecilia was of a very weak
quality. It consisted of throwing pinches of powdered bark of a
certain tree, and other substances, into the fire whilst muttering
a spell&mdash;a prayer repeated backwards&mdash;and adding the name
of the person on whom she wished the incantation to operate. Some
of the feiticeiras, however, play more dangerous tricks than this
harmless mummery. They are acquainted with many poisonous plants,
and although they seldom have the courage to administer a fatal
dose, sometimes contrive to convey to their victim sufficient to
cause serious illness. The motive by which they are actuated is
usually jealousy of other women in love matters. Whilst I resided
in Santarem, a case of what was called witchcraft was tried by the
sub-delegado, in which a highly respectable white lady was the
complainant. It appeared that some feiticeira had sprinkled a
quantity of the acrid juice of a large arum on her linen as it was
hanging out to dry, and it was thought this had caused a serious
eruption under which the lady suffered.</p>

<p>I seldom met with any of the larger animals in these excursions.
We never saw a mammal of any kind on the campos; but tracks of
three species were seen occasionally besides those of the jaguar;
these belonged to a small tiger cat, a deer, and an opossum, all of
which animals must have been very rare, and probably nocturnal in
their habits, with the exception of the deer. I saw in the woods,
on one occasion, a small flock of monkeys, and once had an
opportunity of watching the movements of a sloth. The latter was of
the kind called by Cuvier Bradypus tridactylus, which is clothed
with shaggy grey hair. The natives call it, in the Tup&iacute;
language, A&iuml; ybyret&eacute; (in Portuguese, Pregui&ccedil;a da
terra firme), or sloth of the mainland, to distinguish it from the
Bradypus infuscatus, which has a long, black and tawny stripe
between the shoulders, and is called A&iuml; Ygap&oacute;
(Pregui&ccedil;a das vargens), or sloth of the flooded lands. Some
travellers in South America have described the sloth as very nimble
in its native woods, and have disputed the justness of the name
which has been bestowed upon it. The inhabitants of the Amazons
region, however, both Indians and descendants of the Portuguese,
hold to the common opinion, and consider the sloth as the type of
laziness. It is very common for one native to call another, in
reproaching him for idleness, &ldquo;bicho do Emba&uuml;ba&rdquo;
(beast of the Cecropia tree); the leaves of the Cecropia being the
food of the sloth. It is a strange sight to watch the uncouth
creature, fit production of these silent shades, lazily moving from
branch to branch. Every movement betrays, not indolence exactly,
but extreme caution. He never looses his hold from one branch
without first securing himself to the next, and when he does not
immediately find a bough to grasp with the rigid hooks into which
his paws are so curiously transformed, he raises his body,
supported on his hind legs, and claws around in search of a fresh
foothold. After watching the animal for about half an hour I gave
him a charge of shot. He fell with a terrific crash, but caught a
bough, in his descent, with his powerful claws, and remained
suspended. Our Indian lad tried to climb the tree, but was driven
back by swarms of stinging ants; the poor little fellow slid down
in a sad predicament, and plunged into the brook to free himself.
Two days afterwards I found the body of the sloth on the ground,
the animal having dropped on the relaxation of the muscles a few
hours after death. In one of our voyages, Mr. Wallace and I saw a
sloth (B. infuscatus) swimming across a river, at a place where it
was probably 300 yards broad. I believe it is not generally known
that this animal takes to the water. Our men caught the beast,
cooked, and ate him.</p>

<p>In returning from these trips we were sometimes benighted on the
campos. We did not care for this on moonlit nights, when there was
no danger of losing the path. The great heat felt in the middle
hours of the day is much mitigated by four o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon; a few birds then make their appearance; small flocks of
ground doves run about the stony hillocks parrots pass over and
sometimes settle in the ilhas; pretty little finches of several
species, especially one kind, streaked with olive-brown and yellow,
and somewhat resembling our yellow-hammer, but I believe not
belonging to the same genus, hop about the grass, enlivening the
place with a few musical notes. The Carashu&eacute; (Mimus) also
then resumes its mellow, blackbird-like song; and two or three
species of humming-bird, none of which, however, are peculiar to
the district, flit about from tree to tree. On the other hand, the
little blue and yellow-striped lizards, which abound amongst the
herbage during the scorching heats of midday, retreat towards this
hour to their hiding-places, together with the day-flying insects
and the numerous campo butterflies. Some of these latter resemble
greatly our English species found in heathy places, namely, a
fritillary, Argynnis (Euptoieta) Hegesia, and two smaller kinds,
which are deceptively like the little Nemeobius Lucina. After
sunset, the air becomes delightfully cool and fragrant with the
aroma of fruits and flowers. The nocturnal animals then come forth.
A monstrous hairy spider, five inches in expanse, of a brown colour
with yellowish lines along its stout legs&mdash;which is very
common here, inhabiting broad tubular galleries smoothly lined with
silken web&mdash;may be then caught on the watch at the mouth of
its burrow. It is only seen at night, and I think does not wander
far from its den; the gallery is about two inches in diameter and
runs in a slanting direction, about two feet from the surface of
the soil. As soon as it is night, swarms of goat-suckers suddenly
make their appearance, wheeling about in a noiseless, ghostly
manner, in chase of night-flying insects. They sometimes descend
and settle on a low branch, or even on the pathway close to where
one is walking, and then squatting down on their heels, are
difficult to distinguish from the surrounding soil. One kind has a
long forked tail. In the daytime they are concealed in the wooded
ilhas, where I very often saw them crouched and sleeping on the
ground in the dense shade. They make no nest, but lay their eggs on
the bare ground. Their breeding time is in the rainy season, and
fresh eggs are found from December to June. Later in the evening,
the singular notes of the goat-suckers are heard, one species
crying Quao, Quao, another Chuck-cococao; and these are repeated at
intervals far into the night in the most monotonous manner. A great
number of toads are seen on the bare sandy pathways soon after
sunset. One of them was quite a colossus, about seven inches in
length and three in height. This big fellow would never move out of
the way until we were close to him. If we jerked him out of the
path with a stick, he would slowly recover himself, and then turn
round to have a good impudent stare. I have counted as many as
thirty of these monsters within a distance of half a mile.</p>
