<br>


<p class="first">A trader of Obydos, named Penna, was proceeding
about in a cuberta laden with merchandise to the Rio Negro,
intending to stop frequently on the road, so I bargained with him
for a passage. He gave up a part of the toldo, or fore-cabin as it
may be called, and here I slung my hammock and arranged my boxes so
as to be able to work as we went along. The stoppages I thought
would be an advantage, as I could collect in the woods whilst he
traded, and thus acquire a knowledge of the productions of many
places on the river which on a direct voyage would be impossible to
do. I provided a stock of groceries for two months&rsquo;
consumption; and, after the usual amount of unnecessary fuss and
delay on the part of the owner, we started on the 19th of November.
Penna took his family with him: this comprised a smart, lively
mameluco woman, named Catarina, whom we called Senhora Katita, and
two children. The crew consisted of three men: one a sturdy Indian,
another a Cafuzo, godson of Penna, and the third, our best hand, a
steady, good-natured mulatto, named Joaquim. My boy Luco was to
assist in rowing and so forth. Penna was a timid middle-aged man, a
white with a slight cross of Indian; when he was surly and
obstinate, he used to ask me to excuse him on account of the Tapuyo
blood in his veins. He tried to make me as comfortable as the
circumstances admitted, and provided a large stock of eatables and
drinkables; so that altogether the voyage promised to be a pleasant
one.</p>

<p>On leaving the port of Obydos, we crossed over to the right bank
and sailed with a light wind all day, passing numerous houses, each
surrounded by its grove of cacao trees. On the 20th we made slow
progress. After passing the high land at the mouth of the
Trombetas, the banks were low, clayey, or earthy on both sides. The
breadth of the river varies hereabout from two and a half to three
miles, but neither coast is the true terra firma. On the northern
side a by-channel runs for a long distance inland, communicating
with the extensive lake of Faro; on the south, three channels lead
to the similar fresh-water sea of Villa Franca; these are in part
arms of the river, so that the land they surround consists,
properly speaking, of islands. When this description of land is not
formed wholly of river deposit, as sometimes happens, or is raised
above the level of the highest floods, it is called <i>Ygap&oacute;
alto</i>, and is distinguished by the natives from the true islands
of mid-river, as well as from the terra firma. We landed at one of
the cacao plantations. The house was substantially built; the walls
formed of strong upright posts, lathed across, plastered with mud
and whitewashed, and the roof tiled. The family were mamelucos, and
seemed to be an average sample of the poorer class of cacao
growers. All were loosely dressed and bare-footed. A broad verandah
extended along one side of the house, the floor of which was simply
the well-trodden earth; and here hammocks were slung between the
bare upright supports, a large rush mat being spread on the ground,
upon which the stout matron-like mistress, with a tame parrot
perched upon her shoulder, sat sewing with two pretty little
mulatto girls. The master, coolly clad in shirt and drawers, the
former loose about the neck, lay in his hammock smoking a long
gaudily-painted wooden pipe. The household utensils, earthenware
jars, water-pots and saucepans lay at one end, near which was a
wood fire, with the ever-ready coffee-pot simmering on the top of a
clay tripod. A large shed stood a short distance off, embowered in
a grove of banana, papaw, and mango trees; and under it were the
ovens, troughs, sieves, and all other apparatus for the preparation
of mandioca. The cleared space around the house was only a few
yards in extent; beyond it lay the cacao plantations, which
stretched on each side parallel to the banks of the river. There
was a path through the forest which led to the mandioca fields, and
several miles beyond to other houses on the banks of an interior
channel. We were kindly received, as is always the case when a
stranger visits these out-of-the-way habitations; the people being
invariably civil and hospitable. We had a long chat, took coffee,
and upon departing, one of the daughters sent a basket full of
oranges for our use down to the canoe.</p>

<p>The cost of a cacao plantation in the Obydos district is after
the rate of 240 reis or sixpence per tree, which is much higher
than at Camet&aacute;, where I believe the yield is not so great.
The forest here is cleared before planting, and the trees are grown
in rows. The smaller cultivators are all very poor. Labour is
scarce; one family generally manages its own small plantation of
10,000 to 15,000 trees, but at the harvest time neighbours assist
each other. It appeared to me to be an easy, pleasant life; the
work is all done under shade, and occupies only a few weeks in the
year. The incorrigible nonchalance and laziness of the people alone
prevent them from surrounding themselves with all the luxuries of a
tropical country. They might plant orchards of the choicest fruit
trees around their houses, grow Indian corn, and rear cattle and
hogs, as intelligent settlers from Europe would certainly do,
instead of indolently relying solely on the produce of their small
plantations, and living on a meagre diet of fish and farinha. In
preparing the cacao they have not devised any means of separating
the seeds well from the pulp, or drying it in a systematic way; the
consequence is that, although naturally of good quality, it molds
before reaching the merchants&rsquo; stores, and does not fetch
more than half the price of the same article grown in other parts
of tropical America. The Amazons region is the original home of the
principal species of chocolate tree, the Theobroma cacao; and it
grows in abundance in the forests of the upper river. The
cultivated crop appears to be a precarious one; little or no care,
however, is bestowed on the trees, and even weeding is done very
inefficiently. The plantations are generally old, and have been
made on the low ground near the river, which renders them liable to
inundation when this rises a few inches more than the average.
There is plenty of higher land quite suitable to the tree, but it
is uncleared, and the want of labour and enterprise prevents the
establishment of new plantations.</p>

<p>We passed the last houses in the Obydos district on the 20th,
and the river scenery then resumed its usual wild and solitary
character, which the scattered human habitations relieved, although
in a small degree. We soon fell into a regular mode of life on
board our little ark. Penna would not travel by night; indeed, our
small crew, wearied by the day&rsquo;s labour, required rest, and
we very rarely had wind in the night. We used to moor the vessel to
a tree, giving out plenty of cable, so as to sleep at a distance
from the banks and free of mosquitoes, which although swarming in
the forest, rarely came many yards out into the river at this
season of the year. The strong current at a distance of thirty or
forty yards from the coast steadied the cuberta head to stream, and
kept us from drifting ashore. We all slept in the open air, as the
heat of the cabins was stifling in the early part of the night.
Penna, Senhora Katita, and I slung our hammocks in triangle between
the mainmast and two stout poles fixed in the raised deck. A sheet
was the only covering required, besides our regular clothing, for
the decrease of temperature at night on the Amazons is never so
great as to be felt otherwise than as a delightful coolness after
the sweltering heat of the afternoons. We used to rise when the
first gleam of dawn showed itself above the long, dark line of
forest. Our clothes and hammocks were then generally soaked with
dew, but this was not felt to be an inconvenience. The Indian
Manoel used to revive himself by a plunge in the river, under the
bows of the vessel. It is the habit of all Indians, male and
female, to bathe early in the morning; they do it sometimes for
warmth&rsquo;s sake, the temperature of the water being often
considerably higher than that of the air. Penna and I lolled in our
hammocks, whilst Katita prepared the indispensable cup of strong
coffee, which she did with wonderful celerity, smoking meanwhile
her early morning pipe of tobacco. Liberal owners of river craft
allow a cup of coffee sweetened with molasses, or a ration of
cashaca, to each man of their crews; Penna gave them coffee. When
all were served, the day&rsquo;s work began. There was seldom any
wind at this early hour, so if there was still water along the
shore, the men rowed, if not, there was no way of progressing but
by espia. In some places the currents ran with great force close to
the banks, especially where these receded to form long bays or <i>
enseadas</i>, as they are called, and then we made very little
headway. In such places the banks consist of loose earth, a rich
crumbly vegetable mold supporting a growth of most luxuriant
forest, of which the currents almost daily carry away large
portions, so that the stream for several yards out is encumbered
with fallen trees whose branches quiver in the current. When
projecting points of land were encountered, it was impossible, with
our weak crew, to pull the cuberta against the whirling torrents
which set round them; and in such cases we had to cross the river,
drifting often with the current, a mile or two lower down on the
opposite shore. There generally sprung a light wind as the day
advanced, and then we took down our hammocks, hoisted all sail, and
bowled away merrily. Penna generally preferred to cook the dinner
ashore, when there was little or no wind. About midday on these
calm days, we used to look out for a nice shady nook in the forest
with cleared space sufficient to make a fire upon. I then had an
hour&rsquo;s hunting in the neighbouring wilderness, and was always
rewarded by the discovery of some new species. During the greater
part of our voyage, however, we stopped at the house of some
settler, and made our fire in the port. Just before dinner it was
our habit to take a bath in the river, and then, according to the
universal custom on the Amazons, where it seems to be suitable on
account of the weak fish diet, we each took half a tea-cup full of
neat casha&ccedil;a, the &ldquo;abre&rdquo; or
&ldquo;opening,&rdquo; as it is called, and set to on our mess of
stewed piraruc&uacute;, beans, and bacon. Once or twice a week we
had fowls and rice; at supper, after sunset, we often had fresh
fish caught by our men in the evening. The mornings were cool and
pleasant until towards midday; but in the afternoons, the heat
became almost intolerable, especially in gleamy, squally weather,
such as generally prevailed. We then crouched in the shade of the
sails, or went down to our hammocks in the cabin, choosing to be
half stifled rather than expose ourselves on deck to the sickening
heat of the sun. We generally ceased travelling about nine
o&rsquo;clock, fixing upon a safe spot wherein to secure the vessel
for the night. The cool evening hours were delicious; flocks of
whistling ducks (Anas autumnalis), parrots, and hoarsely-screaming
macaws, pair by pair, flew over from their feeding to their resting
places, as the glowing sun plunged abruptly beneath the horizon.
The brief evening chorus of animals then began, the chief
performers being the howling monkeys, whose frightful unearthly
roar deepened the feeling of solitude which crept up as darkness
closed around us. Soon after, the fireflies in great diversity of
species came forth and flitted about the trees. As night advanced,
all became silent in the forest, save the occasional hooting of
tree-frogs, or the monotonous chirping of wood-crickets and
grasshoppers.</p>

<p>We made but little progress on the 20th and two following days,
on account of the unsteadiness of the wind. The dry season had been
of very brief duration this year; it generally lasts in this part
of the Amazons from July to January, with a short interval of
showery weather in November. The river ought to sink thirty or
thirty-five feet below its highest point; this year it had declined
only about twenty-five feet, and the November rains threatened to
be continuous. The drier the weather the stronger blows the east
wind; it now failed us altogether, or blew gently for a few hours
merely in the afternoons. I had hitherto seen the great river only
in its sunniest aspect; I was now about to witness what it could
furnish in the way of storms.</p>

<p>On the night of the 22nd the moon appeared with a misty halo. As
we went to rest, a fresh watery wind was blowing, and a dark pile
of clouds gathered up river in a direction opposite to that of the
wind. I thought this betokened nothing more than a heavy rain which
would send us all in a hurry to our cabins. The men moored the
vessel to a tree alongside a hard clayey bank, and after supper,
all were soon fast asleep, scattered about the raised deck. About
eleven o&rsquo;clock I was awakened by a horrible uproar, as a
hurricane of wind suddenly swept over from the opposite shore. The
cuberta was hurled with force against the clayey bank; Penna
shouted out, as he started to his legs, that a trovoada de cima, or
a squall from up-river, was upon us. We took down our hammocks, and
then all hands were required to save the vessel from being dashed
to pieces. The moon set, and a black pall of clouds spread itself
over the dark forests and river; a frightful crack of thunder now
burst over our heads, and down fell the drenching rain. Joaquim
leapt ashore through the drowning spray with a strong pole, and
tried to pass the cuberta round a small projecting point, whilst we
on deck aided in keeping her off and lengthened the cable. We
succeeded in getting free, and the stout-built boat fell off into
the strong current farther away from the shore, Joaquim swinging
himself dexterously aboard by the bowsprit as it passed the point.
It was fortunate for us that he happened to be on a sloping clayey
bank where there was no fear of falling trees; a few yards farther
on, where the shore was perpendicular and formed of crumbly earth,
large portions of loose soil, with all their superincumbent mass of
forest, were being washed away; the uproar thus occasioned adding
to the horrors of the storm.</p>

<p>The violence of the wind abated in the course of an hour, but
the deluge of rain continued until about three o&rsquo;clock in the
morning; the sky was lighted up by almost incessant flashes of
pallid lightning, and the thunder pealing from side to side without
interruption. Our clothing, hammocks, and goods were thoroughly
soaked by the streams of water which trickled through between the
planks. In the morning all was quiet, but an opaque, leaden mass of
clouds overspread the sky, throwing a gloom over the wild landscape
that had a most dispiriting effect. These squalls from the west are
always expected about the time of the breaking up of the dry season
in these central parts of the Lower Amazons. They generally take
place about the beginning of February, so that this year they had
commenced much earlier than usual. The soil and climate are much
drier in this part of the country than in the region lying farther
to the west, where the denser forests and more clayey, humid soil
produce a considerably cooler atmosphere. The storms may be,
therefore, attributed to the rush of cold moist air from up river,
when the regular trade-wind coming from the sea has slackened or
ceased to blow.</p>

<p>On the 26th we arrived at a large sand bank connected with an
island in mid-river, in front of an inlet called
Marac&aacute;-uass&uacute;. Here we anchored and spent half a day
ashore. Penna&rsquo;s object in stopping was simply to enjoy a
ramble on the sands with the children, and give Senhora Katita an
opportunity to wash the linen. The sandbank was now fast going
under water with the rise of the river; in the middle of the dry
season it is about a mile long and half a mile in width. The
canoe-men delight in these open spaces, which are a great relief to
the monotony of the forest that clothes the land in every other
part of the river. Farther westward they are much more frequent,
and of larger extent. They lie generally at the upper end of
islands; in fact, the latter originate in accretions of vegetable
matter formed by plants and trees growing on a shoal. The island
was wooded chiefly with the trumpet tree (Cecropia peltata), which
has a hollow stem and smooth pale bark. The leaves are similar in
shape to those of the horse-chestnut, but immensely larger; beneath
they are white, and when the welcome trade-wind blows they show
their silvery undersides,&mdash;a pleasant signal to the weary canoe
traveller. The mode of growth of this tree is curious: the branches
are emitted at nearly right angles with the stem, the branchlets in
minor whorls around these, and so forth, the leaves growing at
their extremities, so that the total appearance is that of a huge
candelabrum. Cecropi&aelig; of different species are characteristic
of Brazilian forest scenery; the kind of which I am speaking grows
in great numbers everywhere on the banks of the Amazons where the
land is low. In the same places the curious Monguba tree (Bombax
ceiba) is also plentiful; the dark green bark of its huge tapering
trunk, scored with grey, forming a conspicuous object. The
principal palm tree on the lowlands is the Jauar&iacute;
(Astryocaryum Jauar&iacute;), whose stem, surrounded by whorls of
spines, shoots up to a great height. On the borders of the island
were large tracts of arrow-grass (Gynerium saccharoides), which
bears elegant plumes of flowers, like those of the reed, and grows
to a height of twenty feet, the leaves arranged in a fan-shaped
figure near the middle of the stem. I was surprised to find on the
higher parts of the sandbank the familiar foliage of a willow
(Salix Humboldtiana). It is a dwarf species, and grows in patches
resembling beds of osiers; as in the English willows, the leaves
were peopled by small chrysomelideous beetles. In wandering about,
many features reminded me of the seashore. Flocks of white gulls
were flying overhead, uttering their well-known cry, and sandpipers
coursed along the edge of the water. Here and there lonely
wading-birds were stalking about; one of these, the Curic&aacute;ca
(Ibis melanopis), flew up with a low cackling noise, and was soon
joined by a unicorn bird (Palamedea cornuta), which I startled up
from amidst the bushes, whose harsh screams, resembling the bray of
a jackass, but shriller, disturbed unpleasantly the solitude of the
place. Amongst the willow bushes were flocks of a handsome bird
belonging to the Icterid&aelig; or troupial family, adorned with a
rich plumage of black and saffron-yellow. I spent some time
watching an assemblage of a species of bird called by the natives
Tumbur&iacute;-par&aacute;, on the Cecropia trees. It is the Monasa
nigrifrons of ornithologists, and has a plain slate-coloured
plumage with the beak of an orange hue. It belongs to the family of
Barbets, most of whose members are remarkable for their dull,
inactive temperament. Those species which are arranged by
ornithologists under the genus Bucco are called by the Indians, in
the Tup&iacute; language, Tai-ass&uacute; uir&aacute;, or
pig-birds. They remain seated sometimes for hours together on low
branches in the shade, and are stimulated to exertion only when
attracted by passing insects. This flock of
Tambur&iacute;-par&aacute; were the reverse of dull; they were
gambolling and chasing each other amongst the branches. As they
sported about, each emitted a few short tuneful notes, which
altogether produced a ringing, musical chorus that quite surprised
me.</p>

<p>On the 27th we reached an elevated wooded promontory, called
Parentins, which now forms the boundary between the provinces of
Par&aacute; and the Amazons. Here we met a small canoe descending
to Santarem. The owner was a free negro named Lima, who, with his
wife, was going down the river to exchange his year&rsquo;s crop of
tobacco for European merchandise. The long shallow canoe was laden
nearly to the water level. He resided on the banks of the
Abacax&iacute;, a river which discharges its waters into the
Canom&aacute;, a broad interior channel which extends from the
river Madeira to the Parentins, a distance of 180 miles. Penna
offered him advantageous terms, so a bargain was struck, and the
man saved his long journey. The negro seemed a frank,
straightforward fellow; he was a native of Pernambuco, but had
settled many years ago in this part of the country. He had with him
a little Indian girl belonging to the Mauh&eacute;s tribe, whose
native seat is the district of country lying in the rear of the
Canom&aacute;, between the Madeira and the Tapajos. The
Mauh&eacute;s are considered, I think with truth, to be a branch of
the great Munduruc&uacute; nation, having segregated from them at a
remote period, and by long isolation acquired different customs and
a totally different language, in a manner which seems to have been
general with the Brazilian aborigines. The Munduruc&uacute;s seem
to have retained more of the general characteristics of the
original Tup&iacute; stock than the Mauh&eacute;s. Senhor Lima told
me, what I afterwards found to be correct, that there were scarcely
two words alike in the languages of the two peoples, although there
are words closely allied to Tup&iacute; in both. The little girl
had not the slightest trace of the savage in her appearance. Her
features were finely shaped, the cheek-bones not at all prominent,
the lips thin, and the expression of her countenance frank and
smiling. She had been brought only a few weeks previously from a
remote settlement of her tribe on the banks of the Abacax&iacute;,
and did not yet know five words of Portuguese. The Indians, as a
general rule, are very manageable when they are young, but it is a
general complaint that when they reach the age of puberty they
become restless and discontented. The rooted impatience of all
restraint then shows itself, and the kindest treatment will not
prevent them running away from their masters; they do not return to
the malocas of their tribes, but join parties who go out to collect
the produce of the forests and rivers, and lead a wandering
semi-savage kind of life.</p>

<p>We remained under the Serra dos Parentins all night. Early the
next morning a light mist hung about the tree-tops, and the forest
resounded with the yelping of Whai&aacute;pu-sai monkeys. I went
ashore with my gun and got a glimpse of the flock, but did not
succeed in obtaining a specimen. They were of small size and
covered with long fur of a uniform grey colour. I think the species
was the Callithrix donacophilus. The rock composing the elevated
ridge of the Parentins is the same coarse iron-cemented
conglomerate which I have often spoken of as occurring near
Par&aacute; and in several other places. Many loose blocks were
scattered about. The forest was extremely varied, and inextricable
coils of woody climbers stretched from tree to tree. Thongs of
cacti were spread over the rocks and tree-trunks. The variety of
small, beautifully-shaped ferns, lichens, and boleti, made the
place quite a museum of cryptogamic plants. I found here two
exquisite species of Longicorn beetles, and a large kind of
grasshopper (Pterochroza) whose broad fore-wings resembled the leaf
of a plant, providing the insect with a perfect disguise when they
were closed; whilst the hind wings were decorated with
gaily-coloured eye-like spots.</p>

<p>The negro left us and turned up a narrow channel, the
Paran&aacute;-mirim dos Ramos (the little river of the branches,
<i>i.e.</i>, having many ramifications), on the road to his home,
130 miles distant. We then continued our voyage, and in the evening
arrived at Villa Nova, a straggling village containing about
seventy houses, many of which scarcely deserve the name, being mere
mud-huts roofed with palm-leaves. We stayed here four days. The
village is built on a rocky bank, composed of the same coarse
conglomerate as that already so often mentioned. In some places a
bed of Tabatinga clay rests on the conglomerate. The soil in the
neighbourhood is sandy, and the forest, most of which appears to be
of second growth, is traversed by broad alleys which terminate to
the south and east on the banks of pools and lakes, a chain of
which extends through the interior of the land. As soon as we
anchored I set off with Luco to explore the district. We walked
about a mile along the marly shore, on which was a thick carpet of
flowering shrubs, enlivened by a great variety of lovely little
butterflies, and then entered the forest by a dry watercourse.
About a furlong inland this opened on a broad placid pool, whose
banks, clothed with grass of the softest green hue, sloped gently
from the water&rsquo;s edge to the compact wall of forest which
encompassed the whole. The pool swarmed with water-fowl; snowy
egrets, dark-coloured striped herons, and storks of various species
standing in rows around its margins. Small flocks of macaws were
stirring about the topmost branches of the trees. Long-legged
pios&oacute;cas (Perra Jacana) stalked over the water plants on the
surface of the pool, and in the bushes on its margin were great
numbers of a kind of canary (Sycalis brasiliensis) of a
greenish-yellow colour, which has a short and not very melodious
song. We had advanced but a few steps when we startled a pair of
the Jabur&uacute;-moleque (Mycteria americana), a powerful bird of
the stork family, four and a half feet in height, which flew up and
alarmed the rest, so that I got only one bird out of the tumultuous
flocks which passed over our heads. Passing towards the farther end
of the pool I saw, resting on the surface of the water, a number of
large round leaves turned up at their edges; they belonged to the
Victoria water-lily. The leaves were just beginning to expand
(December 3rd), some were still under water, and the largest of
those which had reached the surface measured not quite three feet
in diameter. We found a montaria with a paddle in it, drawn up on
the bank, which I took leave to borrow of the unknown owner, and
Luco paddled me amongst the noble plants to search for flowers,
meeting, however, with no success. I learned afterwards that the
plant is common in nearly all the lakes of this neighbourhood. The
natives call it the furno do Piosoca, or oven of the Jacana, the
shape of the leaves being like that of the ovens on which Mandioca
meal is roasted. We saw many kinds of hawks and eagles, one of
which, a black species, the Carac&aacute;ra-&iacute; (Milvago
nudicollis), sat on the top of a tall naked stump, uttering its
hypocritical whining notes. This eagle is considered a bird of ill
omen by the Indians: it often perches on the tops of trees in the
neighbourhood of their huts, and is then said to bring a warning of
death to some member of the household. Others say that its whining
cry is intended to attract other defenceless birds within its
reach. The little courageous flycatcher Bem-ti-vi (Saurophagus
sulphuratus) assembles in companies of four or five, and attacks it
boldly, driving it from the perch where it would otherwise sit for
hours. I shot three hawks of as many different species; and these,
with a Magoary stork, two beautiful gilded-green jacamars (Galbula
chalcocephala), and half-a-dozen leaves of the water-lily, made a
heavy load, with which we trudged off back to the canoe.</p>

<br>
<p>A few years after this visit, namely, in 1854-5, I passed eight
months at Villa Nova. The district of which it is the chief town is
very extensive, for it has about forty miles of linear extent along
the banks of the river; but, the whole does not contain more than
4000 inhabitants. More than half of these are pure-blood Indians
who live in a semi-civilised condition on the banks of the numerous
channels and lakes. The trade of the place is chiefly in
India-rubber, balsam of Copaiba (which are collected on the banks
of the Madeira and the numerous rivers that enter the Canom&aacute;
channel), and salt fish, prepared in the dry season, nearer home.
These articles are sent to Par&aacute; in exchange for European
goods. The few Indian and half-breed families who reside in the
town are many shades inferior in personal qualities and social
condition to those I lived amongst near Par&aacute; and
Camet&aacute;. They live in wretched dilapidated mud-hovels; the
women cultivate small patches of mandioca; the men spend most of
their time in fishing, selling what they do not require themselves
and getting drunk with the most exemplary regularity on cashaca,
purchased with the proceeds.</p>

<p>I made, in this second visit to Villa Nova, an extensive
collection of the natural productions of the neighbourhood. A few
remarks on some of the more interesting of these must suffice. The
forests are very different in their general character from those of
Par&aacute;, and in fact those of humid districts generally
throughout the Amazons. The same scarcity of large-leaved Musaceous
and Marantaceous plants was noticeable here as at Obydos. The
low-lying areas of forest or Ygap&oacute;s, which alternate
everywhere with the more elevated districts, did not furnish the
same luxuriant vegetation as they do in the Delta region of the
Amazons. They are flooded during three or four months in the year,
and when the waters retire, the soil&mdash;to which the very thin
coating of alluvial deposit imparts little fertility&mdash;remains bare,
or covered with a matted bed of dead leaves until the next flood
season. These tracts have then a barren appearance; the trunks and
lower branches of the trees are coated with dried slime, and
disfigured by rounded masses of fresh-water sponges, whose long
horny spicul&aelig; and dingy colours give them the appearance of
hedgehogs. Dense bushes of a harsh, cutting grass, called
Tirir&iacute;ca, form almost the only fresh vegetation in the dry
season. Perhaps the dense shade, the long period during which the
land remains under water, and the excessively rapid desiccation
when the waters retire, all contribute to the barrenness of these
Ygap&oacute;s. The higher and drier land is everywhere sandy, and
tall coarse grasses line the borders of the broad alleys which have
been cut through the second-growth woods. These places swarm with
carapatos, ugly ticks belonging to the genus Ixodes, which mount to
the tips of blades of grass, and attach themselves to the clothes
of passers-by. They are a great annoyance. It occupied me a full
hour daily to pick them off my flesh after my diurnal ramble. There
are two species; both are much flattened in shape, have four pairs
of legs, a thick short proboscis and a horny integument. Their
habit is to attach themselves to the skin by plunging their
proboscides into it, and then suck the blood until their flat
bodies are distended into a globular form. The whole proceeding,
however, is very slow, and it takes them several days to pump their
fill. No pain or itching is felt, but serious sores are caused if
care is not taken in removing them, as the proboscis is liable to
break off and remain in the wound. A little tobacco juice is
generally applied to make them loosen their hold. They do not cling
firmly to the skin by their legs, although each of these has a pair
of sharp and fine claws connected with the tips of the member by
means of a flexible pedicle. When they mount to the summits of
slender blades of grass, or the tips of leaves, they hold on by
their forelegs only, the other three pairs being stretched out so
as to fasten onto any animal which comes their way. The smaller of
the two species is of a yellowish colour; it is the most abundant,
and sometimes falls upon one by scores. When distended, it is about
the size of a No. 8 shot; the larger kind, which fortunately comes
only singly to the work, swells to the size of a pea.</p>

<p>In some parts of the interior, the soil is composed of very
coarse sand and small fragments of quartz; in these places no trees
grow. I visited, in company with the priest, Padre Torquato, one of
these treeless spaces or campos, as they are called, situated five
miles from the village. The road thither led through a varied and
beautiful forest, containing many gigantic trees. I missed the
Assai, Mirt&iacute;, Paxi&uacute;ba, and other palms which are all
found only on rich moist soils, but the noble Bac&aacute;ba was not
uncommon, and there was a great diversity of dwarf species of
Maraj&aacute; palms (Bactris), one of which, called the
Peurir&iacute;ma, was very elegant, growing to a height of twelve
or fifteen feet, with a stem no thicker than a man&rsquo;s finger.
On arriving at the campo, all this beautiful forest abruptly
ceased, and we saw before us an oval tract of land three or four
miles in circumference, destitute even of the smallest bush. The
only vegetation was a crop of coarse hairy grass growing in
patches. The forest formed a hedge all round the isolated field,
and its borders were composed in great part of trees which do not
grow in the dense virgin forest, such as a great variety of bushy
Melastomas, low Byrsomina trees, myrtles, and Lacre-trees, whose
berries exude globules of wax resembling gamboge. On the margins of
the campo wild pine-apples also grew in great quantity. The fruit
was of the same shape as our cultivated kind, but much smaller, the
size being that of a moderately large apple. We gathered several
quite ripe ones; they were pleasant to the taste, of the true
pine-apple flavour, but had an abundance of fully developed seeds,
and only a small quantity of eatable pulp. There was no path beyond
this campo; in fact, all beyond is terra incognita to the
inhabitants of Villa Nova.</p>

"Peuririma Palm (Bactris)." align="left">

<p>The only interesting Mammalian animal which I saw at Villa Nova
was a monkey of a species new to me; it was not, however, a native
of the district, having been brought by a trader from the river
Madeira, a few miles above Borba. It was a howler, probably the
Mycetes stramineus of Geoffroy St. Hilaire. The howlers are the
only kinds of monkey which the natives have not succeeded in
taming. They are often caught, but they do not survive captivity
many weeks. The one of which I am speaking was not quite full
grown. It measured sixteen inches in length, exclusive of the tail;
the whole body was covered with rather long and shining dingy-white
hair, the whiskers and beard only being of a tawny hue. It was kept
in a house, together with a Coait&aacute; and a Caiar&aacute;ra
monkey (Cebus albifrons). Both these lively members of the monkey
order seemed rather to court attention, but the Mycetes slunk away
when anyone approached it. When it first arrived, it occasionally
made a gruff subdued howling noise early in the morning. The deep
volume of sound in the voice of the howling monkeys, as is well
known, is produced by a drum-shaped expansion of the larynx. It was
curious to watch the animal whilst venting its hollow cavernous
roar, and observe how small was the muscular exertion employed.
When howlers are seen in the forest, there are generally three or
four of them mounted on the topmost branches of a tree. It does not
appear that their harrowing roar is emitted from sudden alarm; at
least, it was not so in captive individuals. It is probable,
however, that the noise serves to intimidate their enemies. I did
not meet with the Mycetes stramineus in any other part of the
Amazons region; in the neighbourhood of Par&aacute; a
reddish-coloured species prevails (M. Belzebuth); in the narrow
channels near Breves I shot a large, entirely black kind; another
yellow-handed species, according to the report of the natives,
inhabits the island of Macaj&oacute;, which is probably the M.
flavimanus of Kuhl; some distance up the Tapajos the only howler
found is a brownish-black species; and on the Upper Amazons, the
sole species seen was the Mycetes ursinus, whose fur is of a
shining yellowish-red colour.</p>

<p>In the dry forests of Villa Nova I saw a rattlesnake for the
first time. I was returning home one day through a narrow alley,
when I heard a pattering noise close to me. Hard by was a tall palm
tree, whose head was heavily weighted with parasitic plants, and I
thought the noise was a warning that it was about to fall. The wind
lulled for a few moments, and then there was no doubt that the
noise proceeded from the ground. On turning my head in that
direction, a sudden plunge startled me, and a heavy gliding motion
betrayed a large serpent making off almost from beneath my feet.
The ground is always so encumbered with rotting leaves and branches
that one only discovers snakes when they are in the act of moving
away. The residents of Villa Nova would not believe that I had seen
a rattlesnake in their neighbourhood; in fact, it is not known to
occur in the forests at all, its place being the open campos,
where, near Santarem, I killed several. On my second visit to Villa
Nova I saw another. I had then a favourite little dog, named
Diamante, who used to accompany me in my rambles. One day he rushed
into the thicket, and made a dead set at a large snake, whose head
I saw raised above the herbage. The foolish little brute approached
quite close, and then the serpent reared its tail slightly in a
horizontal position and shook its terrible rattle. It was many
minutes before I could get the dog away; and this incident, as well
as the one already related, shows how slow the reptile is to make
the fatal spring.</p>

<p>I was much annoyed, and at the same time amused, with the
Urub&uacute; vultures. The Portuguese call them corvos or crows; in
colour and general appearance they somewhat resemble rooks, but
they are much larger, and have naked, black, wrinkled skin about
their face and throat. They assemble in great numbers in the
villages about the end of the wet season, and are then ravenous
with hunger. My cook could not leave the kitchen open at the back
of the house for a moment whilst the dinner was cooking, on account
of their thievish propensities. Some of them were always loitering
about, watching their opportunity, and the instant the kitchen was
left unguarded, the bold marauders marched in and lifted the lids
off the saucepans with their beaks to rob them of their contents.
The boys of the village lie in wait, and shoot them with bow and
arrow; and vultures have consequently acquired such a dread of
these weapons, that they may be often kept off by hanging a bow
from the rafters of the kitchen. As the dry season advances, the
hosts of Urub&uacute;s follow the fishermen to the lakes, where
they gorge themselves with the offal of the fisheries. Towards
February, they return to the villages, and are then not nearly so
ravenous as before their summer trips.</p>

<p>The insects of Villa Nova are, to a great extent, the same as
those of Santarem and the Tapajos. A few species of all orders,
however, are found here, which occurred nowhere else on the
Amazons, besides several others which are properly considered local
varieties or races of others found at Par&aacute;, on the Northern
shore of the Amazons, or in other parts of Tropical America. The
Hymenoptera were especially numerous, as they always are in
districts which possess a sandy soil: but the many interesting
facts which I gleaned relative to their habits will be more
conveniently introduced when I treat of the same or similar species
found in the localities above-named. In the broad alleys of the
forest several species of Morpho were common. One of these is a
sister form to the Morpho Hecuba, which I have mentioned as
occurring at Obydos. The Villa Nova kind differs from Hecuba
sufficiently to be considered a distinct species, and has been
described under the name of M. Cisseis; but it is clearly only a
local variety of it, the range of the two being limited by the
barrier of the broad Amazons. It is a grand sight to see these
colossal butterflies by twos and threes floating at a great height
in the still air of a tropical morning. They flap their wings only
at long intervals, for I have noticed them to sail a very
considerable distance without a stroke. Their wing-muscles and the
thorax to which they are attached are very feeble in comparison
with the wide extent and weight of the wings; but the large expanse
of these members doubtless assists the insects in maintaining their
aerial course. Morphos are amongst the most conspicuous of the
insect denizens of Tropical American forests, and the broad glades
of the Villa Nova woods seemed especially suited to them, for I
noticed here six species. The largest specimens of Morpho Cisseis
measure seven inches and a half in expanse. Another smaller kind,
which I could not capture, was of a pale silvery-blue colour, and
the polished surface of its wings flashed like a silver speculum as
the insect flapped its wings at a great elevation in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>To resume our voyage. We left Villa Nova on the 4th of December.
A light wind on the 5th carried us across to the opposite shore and
past the mouth of the Paran&aacute;-mir&iacute;m do arco, or the
little river of the bow, so-called on account of its being a short
arm of the main river, of a curved shape, and rejoining the Amazons
a little below Villa Nova. On the 6th, after passing a large island
in mid-river, we arrived at a place where a line of perpendicular
clay cliffs, called the Barreiros de Cararauc&uacute;, diverts
slightly the course of the main stream, as at Obydos. A little
below these cliffs were a few settlers&rsquo; houses; here Penna
remained ten days to trade, a delay which I turned to good account
in augmenting very considerably my collections.</p>

<p>At the first house a festival was going forward. We anchored at
some distance from the shore, on account of the water being shoaly,
and early in the morning three canoes put off, laden with salt
fish, oil of manatee, fowls and bananas, wares which the owners
wished to exchange for different articles required for the festa.
Soon after I went ashore. The head man was a tall, well- made,
civilised Tapuyo, named Marcellino, who, with his wife, a thin,
active, wiry old squaw, did the honours of their house, I thought,
admirably. The company consisted of fifty or sixty Indians and
Mamelucos; some of them knew Portuguese, but the Tup&iacute;
language was the only one used amongst themselves. The festival was
in honour of our Lady of Conception; and, when the people learnt
that Penna had on board an image of the saint handsomer than their
own, they put off in their canoes to borrow it; Marcellino taking
charge of the doll, covering it carefully with a neatly-bordered
white towel. On landing with the image, a procession was formed
from the port to the house, and salutes fired from a couple of
lazarino guns, the saint being afterwards carefully deposited in
the family oratorio. After a litany and hymn were sung in the
evening, all assembled to supper around a large mat spread on a
smooth terrace-like space in front of the house. The meal consisted
of a large boiled Piraruc&uacute;, which had been harpooned for the
purpose in the morning, stewed and roasted turtle, piles of
mandioca-meal and bananas. The old lady, with two young girls,
showed the greatest activity in waiting on the guests, Marcellino
standing gravely by, observing what was wanted and giving the
necessary orders to his wife. When all was done, hard drinking
began, and soon after there was a dance, to which Penna and I were
invited. The liquor served was chiefly a spirit distilled by the
people themselves from mandioca cakes. The dances were all of the
same class, namely, different varieties of the
&ldquo;Landum,&rdquo; an erotic dance similar to the fandango,
originally learned from the Portuguese. The music was supplied by a
couple of wire-stringed guitars, played alternately by the young
men. All passed off very quietly considering the amount of strong
liquor drunk, and the ball was kept up until sunrise the next
morning.</p>

<p>We visited all the houses one after the other. One of them was
situated in a charming spot, with a broad sandy beach before it, at
the entrance to the Paran&aacute;-mir&iacute;m do Mucambo, a
channel leading to an interior lake, peopled by savages of the
M&uacute;ra tribe. This seemed to be the abode of an industrious
family, but all the men were absent, salting Piraruc&uacute; on the
lakes. The house, like its neighbours, was simply a framework of
poles thatched with palm-leaves, the walls roughly latticed and
plastered with mud; but it was larger, and much cleaner inside than
the others. It was full of women and children, who were busy all
day with their various employments; some weaving hammocks in a
large clumsy frame, which held the warp whilst the shuttle was
passed by the hand slowly across the six foot breadth of web;
others were spinning cotton, and others again scraping, pressing,
and roasting mandioca. The family had cleared and cultivated a
large piece of ground; the soil was of extraordinary richness, the
perpendicular banks of the river, near the house, revealing a depth
of many feet of crumbling vegetable mould. There was a large
plantation of tobacco, besides the usual patches of Indian-corn,
sugar-cane, and mandioca; and a grove of cotton, cacao, coffee, and
fruit-trees surrounded the house. We passed two nights at anchor in
shoaly water off the beach. The weather was most beautiful, and
scores of Dolphins rolled and snorted about the canoe all
night.</p>

<p>We crossed the river at this point, and entered a narrow channel
which penetrates the interior of the island of
Tupinambar&aacute;na, and leads to a chain of lakes called the
Lagos de Cararaucu. A furious current swept along the coast, eating
into the crumbling earthy banks, and strewing the river with debris
of the forest. The mouth of the channel lies about twenty-five
miles from Villa Nova; the entrance is only about forty yards
broad, but it expands, a short distance inland, into a large sheet
of water. We suffered terribly from insect pests during the
twenty-four hours we remained here. At night it was quite
impossible to sleep for mosquitoes; they fell upon us by myriads,
and without much piping came straight at our faces as thick as
raindrops in a shower. The men crowded into the cabins, and then
tried to expel the pests by the smoke from burnt rags, but it was
of little avail, although we were half suffocated during the
operation. In the daytime, the Mot&uacute;ca, a much larger and
more formidable fly than the mosquito, insisted upon levying his
tax of blood. We had been tormented by it for many days past, but
this place seemed to be its metropolis. The species has been
described by Perty, the author of the Entomological portion of
Spix, and Martius&rsquo; travels, under the name of Hadrus
lepidotus. It is a member of the Tabanid&aelig; family, and indeed
is closely related to the H&aelig;matopota pluvialis, a brown fly
which haunts the borders of woods in summer time in England. The
Motuca is of a bronzed-black colour; its proboscis is formed of a
bundle of horny lancets, which are shorter and broader than is
usually the case in the family to which it belongs. Its puncture
does not produce much pain, but it makes such a large gash in the
flesh that the blood trickles forth in little streams. Many scores
of them were flying about the canoe all day, and sometimes eight or
ten would settle on one&rsquo;s ankles at the same time. It is
sluggish in its motions, and may be easily killed with the fingers
when it settles. Penna went forward in the montaria to the Pirarucu
fishing stations, on a lake lying further inland; but he did not
succeed in reaching them on account of the length and intricacy of
the channels; so after wasting a day, during which, however, I had
a profitable ramble in the forest, we again crossed the river, and
on the 16th continued our voyage along the northern shore.</p>

<p>The clay cliffs of Cararauc&uacute; are several miles in length.
The hard pink-and-red-coloured beds are here extremely thick, and
in some places present a compact, stony texture. The total height
of the cliff is from thirty to sixty feet above the mean level of
the river, and the clay rests on strata of the same coarse iron-
cemented conglomerate which has already been so often mentioned.
Large blocks of this latter have been detached and rolled by the
force of currents up parts of the cliff where they are seen resting
on terraces of the clay. On the top of all lies a bed of sand and
vegetable mold, which supports a lofty forest, growing up to the
very brink of the precipice. After passing these barreiros we
continued our way along a low uninhabited coast, clothed, wherever
it was elevated above high-water mark, with the usual
vividly-coloured forests of the higher Ygap&oacute; lands, to which
the broad and regular fronds of the Murumur&uacute; palm, here
extremely abundant, served as a great decoration. Wherever the land
was lower than the flood height of the Amazons, Cecropia trees
prevailed, sometimes scattered over meadows of tall broad-leaved
grasses, which surrounded shallow pools swarming with water-fowl.
Alligators were common on most parts of the coast; in some places
we also saw small herds of Capybaras (a large Rodent animal, like a
colossal Guinea-pig) amongst the rank herbage on muddy banks, and
now and then flocks of the graceful squirrel monkey (Chrysothrix
sciureus), whilst the vivacious Caiar&aacute;ra (Cebus albifrons)
were seen taking flying leaps from tree to tree. On the 22nd, we
passed the mouth of the most easterly of the numerous channels
which lead to the large interior lake of Sarac&aacute;, and on the
23rd threaded a series of passages between islands, where we again
saw human habitations, ninety miles distant from the last house at
Cararauc&uacute;. On the 24th we arrived at Serpa.</p>

<p>Serpa is a small village, consisting of about eighty houses,
built on a bank elevated twenty-five feet above the level of the
river. The beds of Tabat&iacute;nga clay, which are here
intermingled with scoria-looking conglomerate, are in some parts of
the declivity prettily variegated in colour; the name of the town
in the Tup&iacute; language, Ita-coati&aacute;ra, takes its origin
from this circumstance, signifying striped or painted rock. It is
an old settlement, and was once the seat of the district
government, which had authority over the Barra of the Rio Negro. It
was in 1849 a wretched-looking village, but it has since revived,
on account of having been chosen by the Steamboat Company of the
Amazons as a station for steam saw-mills and tile manufactories. We
arrived on Christmas Eve, when the village presented an animated
appearance from the number of people congregated for the holidays.
The port was full of canoes, large and small&mdash;from the
montaria, with its arched awning of woven lianas and Maranta
leaves, to the two-masted cuberta of the peddling trader, who had
resorted to the place in the hope of trafficking with settlers
coming from remote sitios to attend the festival. We anchored close
to an igarit&eacute;, whose owner was an old Jur&iacute; Indian,
disfigured by a large black tatooed patch in the middle of his
face, and by his hair being close cropped, except a fringe in front
of the head. In the afternoon we went ashore. The population seemed
to consist chiefly of semi-civilised Indians, living as usual in
half-finished mud hovels. The streets were irregularly laid out,
and overrun with weeds and bushes swarming with
&ldquo;mocuim,&rdquo; a very minute scarlet acarus, which sweeps
off to one&rsquo;s clothes in passing, and attaching itself in
great numbers to the skin causes a most disagreeable itching. The
few whites and better class of mameluco residents live in more
substantial dwellings, white-washed and tiled. All, both men and
women, seemed to me much more cordial, and at the same time more
brusque in their manners, than any Brazilians I had yet met with.
One of them, Captain Manoel Joaquim, I knew for a long time
afterwards; a lively, intelligent, and thoroughly good-hearted man,
who had quite a reputation throughout the interior of the country
for generosity, and for being a firm friend of foreign residents
and stray travellers. Some of these excellent people were men of
substance, being owners of trading vessels, slaves, and extensive
plantations of cacao and tobacco.</p>

<p>We stayed at Serpa five days. Some of the ceremonies observed at
Christmas were interesting, inasmuch as they were the same, with
little modification, as those taught by the Jesuit missionaries
more than a century ago to the aboriginal tribes whom they had
induced to settle on this spot. In the morning, all the women and
girls, dressed in white gauze chemises and showy calico print
petticoats, went in procession to church, first going the round of
the town to take up the different &ldquo;mordomos,&rdquo; or
stewards, whose office is to assist the Juiz of the festa. These
stewards carried each a long white reed, decorated with coloured
ribbons; several children also accompanied, grotesquely decked with
finery. Three old squaws went in front, holding the
&ldquo;sair&eacute;,&rdquo; a large semi-circular frame, clothed
with cotton and studded with ornaments, bits of looking-glass, and
so forth. This they danced up and down, singing all the time a
monotonous whining hymn in the Tup&iacute; language, and at
frequent intervals turning round to face the followers, who then
all stopped for a few moments. I was told that this saire was a
device adopted by the Jesuits to attract the savages to church, for
these everywhere followed the mirrors, in which they saw as it were
magically reflected their own persons. In the evening good-humoured
revelry prevailed on all sides. The negroes, who had a saint of
their own colour&mdash;St. Benedito&mdash;had their holiday apart from the
rest, and spent the whole night singing and dancing to the music of
a long drum (gamb&aacute;) and the caracash&aacute;. The drum was a
hollow log, having one end covered with skin, and was played by the
performer sitting astride upon it, and drumming with his knuckles.
The caracasha is a notched bamboo tube, which produces a harsh
rattling noise by passing a hard stick over the notches. Nothing
could exceed in dreary monotony this music and the singing and
dancing, which were kept up with unflagging vigour all night long.
The Indians did not get up a dance; for the whites and mamelucos
had monopolised all the pretty coloured girls for their own ball,
and the older squaws preferred looking on to taking a part
themselves. Some of their husbands joined the negroes, and got
drunk very quickly. It was amusing to notice how voluble the
usually taciturn redskins became under the influence of liquor. The
negroes and Indians excused their own intemperance by saying the
whites were getting drunk at the other end of the town, which was
quite true.</p>

<p>We left Serpa on the 29th of December, in company of an old
planter named Senhor Joao (John) Trinidade, at whose sitio,
situated opposite the mouth of the Madeira, Penna intended to spend
a few days. Our course on the 29th and 30th lay through narrow
channels between islands. On the 31st we passed the last of these,
and then beheld to the south a sea-like expanse of water, where the
Madeira, the greatest tributary of the Amazons, after 2000 miles of
course, blends its waters with those of the king of rivers. I was
hardly prepared for a junction of waters on so vast a scale as
this, now nearly 900 miles from the sea. Whilst travelling week
after week along the somewhat monotonous stream, often hemmed in
between islands, and becoming thoroughly familiar with it, my sense
of the magnitude of this vast water system had become gradually
deadened; but this noble sight renewed the first feelings of
wonder. One is inclined, in such places as these, to think the
Paraenses do not exaggerate much when they call the Amazons the
Mediterranean of South America. Beyond the mouth of the Madeira,
the Amazons sweeps down in a majestic reach, to all appearance not
a whit less in breadth before than after this enormous addition to
its waters. The Madeira does not ebb and flow simultaneously with
the Amazons; it rises and sinks about two months earlier, so that
it was now fuller than the main river. Its current therefore,
poured forth freely from its mouth, carrying with it a long line of
floating trees and patches of grass which had been torn from its
crumbly banks in the lower part of its course. The current,
however, did not reach the middle of the main stream, but swept
along nearer to the southern shore.</p>

<p>A few items of information which I gleaned relative to this
river may find a place here. The Madeira is navigable for about 480
miles from its mouth; a series of cataracts and rapids then
commences, which extends, with some intervals of quiet water, about
160 miles, beyond which is another long stretch of navigable
stream. Canoes sometimes descend from Villa Bella, in the interior
province of Matto Grosso, but not so frequently as formerly, and I
could hear of very few persons who had attempted of late years to
ascend the river to that point. It was explored by the Portuguese
in the early part of the eighteenth century, the chief and now the
only town on its banks, Borba, 150 miles from its mouth, being
founded in 1756. Up to the year 1853, the lower part of the river,
as far as about a hundred miles beyond Borba, was regularly visited
by traders from Villa Nova, Serpa, and Barra, to collect
sarsaparilla, copauba balsam, turtle-oil, and to trade with the
Indians, with whom their relations were generally on a friendly
footing. In that year many India-rubber collectors resorted to this
region, stimulated by the high price (2s. 6d. a pound) which the
article was at that time fetching at Par&aacute;; and then the
Araras, a fierce and intractable tribe of Indians, began to be
troublesome. They attacked several canoes and massacred everyone on
board, the Indian crews as well as the white traders. Their plan
was to lurk in ambush near the sandy beaches where canoes stop for
the night, and then fall upon the people whilst asleep. Sometimes
they came under pretence of wishing to trade, and then as soon as
they could get the trader at a disadvantage, shot him and his crew
from behind trees. Their arms were clubs, bows, and Taqu&aacute;ra
arrows, the latter a formidable weapon tipped with a piece of
flinty bamboo shaped like a spear-head; they could propel it with
such force as to pierce a man completely through the body. The
whites of Borba made reprisals, inducing the warlike
Munduruc&uacute;s, who had an old feud with the Ar&aacute;ras, to
assist them. This state of things lasted two or three years, and
made a journey up the Madeira a risky undertaking, as the savages
attacked all comers. Besides the Ar&aacute;ras and the
Munduruc&uacute;s, the latter a tribe friendly to the whites,
attached to agriculture, and inhabiting the interior of the country
from the Madeira to beyond the Tapajos, two other tribes of Indians
now inhabit the lower Madeira, namely, the Parentintins and the
M&uacute;ras. Of the former I did not hear much; the M&uacute;ras
lead a lazy quiet life on the banks of the labyrinths of lakes and
channels which intersect the low country on both sides of the river
below Borba. The Ar&aacute;ras are one of those tribes which do not
plant mandioca; and indeed have no settled habitations. They are
very similar in stature and other physical features to the
Munduruc&uacute;s, although differing from them so widely in habits
and social condition. They paint their chins red with Uruc&uacute;
(Anatto), and have usually a black tattooed streak on each side of
the face, running from the corner of the mouth to the temple. They
have not yet learned the use of firearms, have no canoes, and spend
their lives roaming over the interior of the country, living on
game and wild fruits. When they wish to cross a river, they make a
temporary canoe with the thick bark of trees, which they secure in
the required shape of a boat by means of lianas. I heard it stated
by a trader of Santarem, who narrowly escaped being butchered by
them in 1854, that the Araras numbered 2000 fighting men. The
number I think must be exaggerated, as it generally is with regard
to Brazilian tribes. When the Indians show a hostile disposition to
the whites, I believe it is most frequently owing to some
provocation they have received at their hands; for the first
impulse of the Brazilian red-man is to respect Europeans; they have
a strong dislike to be forced into their service, but if strangers
visit them with a friendly intention they are well treated. It is
related, however, that the Indians of the Madeira were hostile to
the Portuguese from the first; it was then the tribes of
M&uacute;ras and Torazes who attacked travellers. In 1855 I met
with an American, an odd character named Kemp, who had lived for
many years amongst the Indians on the Madeira, near the abandoned
settlement of Crato. He told me his neighbours were a
kindly-disposed and cheerful people, and that the onslaught of the
Araras was provoked by a trader from Bara, who wantonly fired into
a family of them, killing the parents, and carrying off their
children to be employed as domestic servants.</p>

<br>
<p>We remained nine days at the sitio of Senhor John Trinidade. It
is situated on a tract of high Ygap&oacute; land, which is raised,
however, only a few inches above high-water mark. This skirts the
northern shore for a long distance; the soil consisting of alluvium
and rich vegetable mould, and exhibiting the most exuberant
fertility. Such districts are the first to be settled on in this
country, and the whole coast for many miles was dotted with
pleasant-looking sitios like that of our friend. The establishment
was a large one, the house and out-buildings covering a large space
of ground. The industrious proprietor seemed to be
Jack-of-all-trades; he was planter, trader, fisherman, and
canoe-builder, and a large igarit&eacute; was now on the stocks
under a large shed. There was great pleasure in contemplating this
prosperous farm, from its being worked almost entirely by free
labour; in fact, by one family, and its dependents. John Trinidade
had only one female slave; his other workpeople were a brother and
sister-in-law, two godsons, a free negro, one or two Indians, and a
family of M&uacute;ras. Both he and his wife were mamelucos; the
negro children called them always father and mother. The order,
abundance, and comfort about the place showed what industry and
good management could effect in this country without slave-labour.
But the surplus produce of such small plantations is very trifling.
All we saw had been done since the disorders of 1835-6, during
which John Trinidade was a great sufferer; he was obliged to fly,
and the M&uacute;ra Indians destroyed his house and plantations.
There was a large, well-weeded grove of cacao along the banks of
the river, comprising about 8000 trees, and further inland
considerable plantations of tobacco, mandioca, Indian corn, fields
of rice, melons, and watermelons. Near the house was a kitchen
garden, in which grew cabbages and onions, introduced from Europe,
besides a wonderful variety of tropical vegetables. It must not be
supposed that these plantations and gardens were enclosed or neatly
kept, such is never the case in this country where labour is so
scarce; but it was an unusual thing to see vegetables grown at all,
and the ground tolerably well weeded. The space around the house
was plentifully planted with fruit-trees, some, belonging to the
Anonaceous order, yielding delicious fruits large as a
child&rsquo;s head, and full of custardy pulp which it is necessary
to eat with a spoon; besides oranges, lemons, guavas, alligator
pears, Ab&iacute;us (Achras cainito), Genipapas, and bananas. In
the shade of these, coffee trees grew in great luxuriance. The
table was always well supplied with fish, which the M&uacute;ra who
was attached to the household as fisherman caught every morning a
few hundred yards from the port. The chief kinds were the Surubim,
Pira-pe&euml;ua, and Piramut&aacute;ba, three species of
Silurid&aelig;, belonging to the genus Pimelodus. To these we used
a sauce in the form of a yellow paste, quite new to me, called
Arub&eacute;, which is made of the poisonous juice of the mandioca
root, boiled down before the starch or tapioca is precipitated, and
seasoned with capsicum peppers. It is kept in stone bottles several
weeks before using, and is a most appetising relish to fish.
Tucup&iacute;, another sauce made also from mandioca juice, is much
more common in the interior of the country than Arub&eacute;. This
is made by boiling or heating the pure liquid, after the tapioca
has been separated, daily for several days in succession, and
seasoning it with peppers and small fishes; when old, it has the
taste of essence of anchovies. It is generally made as a liquid,
but the Jur&iacute; and Miranha tribes on the Japur&aacute; make it
up in the form of a black paste by a mode of preparation I could
not learn; it is then called Tucup&iacute;-pix&uacute;na, or black
Tucup&iacute;. I have seen the Indians on the Tapajos, where fish
is scarce, season Tucup&iacute; with Sa&uuml;ba ants. It is there
used chiefly as a sauce to Tacac&aacute;, another preparation from
mandioca, consisting of the starch beaten up in boiling water.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed the nine days we spent at this place. Our
host and hostess took an interest in my pursuit; one of the best
chambers in the house was given up to me, and the young men took me
on long rambles in the neighbouring forests. I saw very little hard
work going forward. Everyone rose with the dawn, and went down to
the river to bathe; then came the never-failing cup of rich and
strong coffee, after which all proceeded to their avocations. At
this time, nothing was being done at the plantations; the cacao and
tobacco crops were not ripe; weeding time was over; and the only
work on foot was the preparation of a little farinha by the women.
The men dawdled about; went shooting and fishing, or did trifling
jobs about the house. The only laborious work done during the year
in these establishments is the felling of timber for new clearings;
this happens at the beginning of the dry season, namely, from July
to September. Whatever employment the people were engaged in, they
did not intermit it during the hot hours of the day. Those who went
into the woods took their dinners with them&mdash;a small bag of
farinha, and a slice of salt fish. About sunset all returned to the
house; they then had their frugal suppers, and towards eight
o&rsquo;clock, after coming to ask a blessing of the patriarchal
head of the household, went off to their hammocks to sleep.</p>

<p>There was another visitor besides ourselves, a negro, whom John
Trinidade introduced to me as his oldest and dearest friend, who
had saved his life during the revolt of 1835. I have,
unfortunately, forgotten his name; he was a freeman, and had a
sitio of his own situated about a day&rsquo;s journey from this.
There was the same manly bearing about him that I had noticed with
pleasure in many other free negroes; but his quiet, earnest manner,
and the thoughtful and benevolent expression of his countenance,
showed him to be a superior man of his class. He told me he had
been intimate with our host for thirty years, and that a wry word
had never passed between them. At the commencement of the disorders
of 1835, he got into the secret of a plot for assassinating his
friend, hatched by some villains whose only cause of enmity was
their owing him money and envying his prosperity. It was such as
these who aroused the stupid and brutal animosity of the
M&uacute;ras against the whites. The negro, on obtaining this news,
set off alone in a montaria on a six hours&rsquo; journey in the
dead of night to warn his &ldquo;compadre&rdquo; of the fate in
store for him, and thus gave him time to fly. It was a pleasing
sight to notice the cordiality of feeling and respect for each
other shown by these two old men; for they used to spend hours
together enjoying the cool breeze, seated under a shed which
overlooked the broad river, and talking of old times.</p>

<p>John Trinidade was famous for his tobacco and cigarettes, as he
took great pains in preparing the Tauar&iacute;, or envelope, which
is formed of the inner bark of a tree, separated into thin papery
layers. Many trees yield it, amongst them the Courataria Guianensis
and the Sapucaya nut-tree, both belonging to the same natural
order. The bark is cut into long strips, of a breadth suitable for
folding the tobacco; the inner portion is then separated, boiled,
hammered with a wooden mallet, and exposed to the air for a few
hours. Some kinds have a reddish colour and an astringent taste,
but the sort prepared by our host was of a beautiful satiny-white
hue, and perfectly tasteless. He obtained sixty, eighty, and
sometimes a hundred layers from the same strip of bark. The best
tobacco in Brazil is grown in the neighbourhood of Borba, on the
Madeira, where the soil is a rich black loam; but tobacco of very
good quality was grown by John Trinidade and his neighbours along
this coast, on similar soil. It is made up into slender rolls, an
inch and a half in diameter and six feet in length, tapering at
each end. When the leaves are gathered and partially dried, layers
of them, after the mid-ribs are plucked out, are placed on a mat
and rolled up into the required shape. This is done by the women
and children, who also manage the planting, weeding, and gathering
of the tobacco. The process of tightening the rolls is a long and
heavy task, and can be done only by men. The cords used for this
purpose are of very great strength. They are made of the inner bark
of a peculiar light-wooded and slender tree, called
Uaiss&iacute;ma, which yields, when beaten out, a great quantity of
most beautiful silky fibre, many feet in length. I think this might
be turned to some use by English manufacturers, if they could
obtain it in large quantity. The tree is abundant on light soils on
the southern side of the Lower Amazons, and grows very rapidly.
When the rolls are sufficiently well pressed, they are bound round
with narrow thongs of remarkable toughness, cut from the bark of
the climbing Jacit&aacute;ra palm tree (Desmoncus macracanthus),
and are then ready for sale or use.</p>

<p>It was very pleasant to roam in our host&rsquo;s cacaoal. The
ground was clear of underwood, the trees were about thirty feet in
height, and formed a dense shade. Two species of monkey frequented
the trees, and I was told committed great depredations when the
fruit was ripe. One of these, the macaco prego (Cebus cirrhifer?),
is a most impudent thief; it destroys more than it eats by its
random, hasty way of plucking and breaking the fruits, and when
about to return to the forest, carries away all it can in its hands
or under its arms. The other species, the pretty little Chrysothrix
sciureus, contents itself with devouring what it can on the spot. A
variety of beautiful insects basked on the foliage where stray
gleams of sunlight glanced through the canopy of broad soft-green
leaves, and numbers of an elegant, long-legged tiger-beetle
(Odontocheila egregia) ran and flew about over the herbage.</p>

<p>We left this place on the 8th of January, and on the afternoon
of the 9th, arrived at Matari, a miserable little settlement of
M&uacute;ra Indians. Here we again anchored and went ashore. The
place consisted of about twenty slightly-built mud-hovels, and had
a most forlorn appearance, notwithstanding the luxuriant forest in
its rear. A horde of these Indians settled here many years ago, on
the site of an abandoned missionary station; and the government had
lately placed a resident director over them, with the intention of
bringing the hitherto intractable savages under authority. This,
however, seemed to promise no other result than that of driving
them to their old solitary haunts on the banks of the interior
waters, for many families had already withdrawn themselves. The
absence of the usual cultivated trees and plants gave the place a
naked and poverty-stricken aspect. I entered one of the hovels
where several women were employed cooking a meal. Portions of a
large fish were roasting over a fire made in the middle of the low
chamber, and the entrails were scattered about the floor, on which
the women with their children were squatted. These had a timid,
distrustful expression of countenance, and their bodies were
begrimed with black mud, which is smeared over the skin as a
protection against mosquitoes. The children were naked, the women
wore petticoats of coarse cloth, ragged round the edges, and
stained in blotches with murix&iacute;, a dye made from the bark of
a tree. One of them wore a necklace of monkey&rsquo;s teeth. There
were scarcely any household utensils; the place was bare with the
exception of two dirty grass hammocks hung in the corners. I missed
the usual mandioca sheds behind the house, with their surrounding
cotton, cacao, coffee, and lemon trees. Two or three young men of
the tribe were lounging about the low open doorway. They were
stoutly-built fellows, but less well-proportioned than the
semi-civilised Indians of the Lower Amazons generally are. Their
breadth of chest was remarkable, and their arms were wonderfully
thick and muscular. The legs appeared short in proportion to the
trunk; the expression of their countenances was unmistakably more
sullen and brutal, and the skin of a darker hue than is common in
the Brazilian red man. Before we left the hut, an old couple came
in; the husband carrying his paddle, bow, arrows, and harpoon, the
woman bent beneath the weight of a large basket filled with palm
fruits. The man was of low stature and had a wild appearance from
the long coarse hair which hung over his forehead. Both his lips
were pierced with holes, as is usual with the older M&uacute;ras
seen on the river. They used formerly to wear tusks of the wild hog
in these holes whenever they went out to encounter strangers or
their enemies in war. The gloomy savagery, filth, and poverty of
the people in this place made me feel quite melancholy, and I was
glad to return to the canoe. They offered us no civilities; they
did not even pass the ordinary salutes, which all the
semi-civilised and many savage Indians proffer on a first meeting.
The men persecuted Penna for casha&ccedil;a, which they seemed to
consider the only good thing the white man brings with him. As they
had nothing whatever to give in exchange, Penna declined to supply
them. They followed us as we descended to the port, becoming very
troublesome when about a dozen had collected together. They brought
their empty bottles with them and promised fish and turtle, if we
would only trust them first with the coveted aguardente, or cau-im,
as they called it. Penna was inexorable; he ordered the crew to
weigh anchor, and the disappointed savages remained hooting after
us with all their might from the top of the bank as we glided
away.</p>

<p>The M&uacute;ras have a bad reputation all over this part of the
Amazons, the semi-civilised Indians being quite as severe upon them
as the white settlers. Everyone spoke of them as lazy, thievish,
untrustworthy, and cruel. They have a greater repugnance than any
other class of Indians to settled habits, regular labour, and the
service of the whites; their distaste, in fact, to any
approximation towards civilised life is invincible. Yet most of
these faults are only an exaggeration of the fundamental defects of
character in the Brazilian red man. There is nothing, I think, to
show that the M&uacute;ras had a different origin from the nobler
agricultural tribes belonging to the Tup&iacute; nation, to some of
whom they are close neighbours, although the very striking contrast
in their characters and habits would suggest the conclusion that
their origin had been different, in the same way as the Semangs of
Malacca, for instance, with regard to the Malays. They are merely
an offshoot from them, a number of segregated hordes becoming
degraded by a residence most likely of very many centuries in
Ygap&oacute; lands, confined to a fish diet, and obliged to wander
constantly in search of food. Those tribes which are supposed to be
more nearly related to the Tup&iacute;s are distinguished by their
settled agricultural habits, their living in well-constructed
houses, their practice of many arts, such as the manufacture of
painted earthenware, weaving, and their general custom of
tattooing, social organisation, obedience to chiefs, and so forth.
The M&uacute;ras have become a nation of nomade fishermen, ignorant
of agriculture and all other arts practised by their neighbours.
They do not build substantial and fixed dwellings, but live in
separate families or small hordes, wandering from place to place
along the margins of those rivers and lakes which most abound in
fish and turtle. At each resting-place they construct temporary
huts at the edge of the stream, shifting them higher or lower on
the banks, as the waters advance or recede. Their canoes originally
were made simply of the thick bark of trees, bound up into a
semi-cylindrical shape by means of woody lianas; these are now
rarely seen, as most families possess montarias, which they have
contrived to steal from the settlers from time to time. Their food
is chiefly fish and turtle, which they are very expert in
capturing. It is said by their neighbours that they dive after
turtles, and succeed in catching them by the legs, which I believe
is true in the shallow lakes where turtles are imprisoned in the
dry season. They shoot fish with bow and arrow, and have no notion
of any other method of cooking it than by roasting. It is not quite
clear whether the whole tribe were originally quite ignorant of
agriculture; as some families on the banks of the streams behind
Villa Nova, who could scarcely have acquired the art in recent
times, plant mandioca, but, as a general rule, the only vegetable
food used by the M&uacute;ras is bananas and wild fruits. The
original home of this tribe was the banks of the Lower Madeira. It
appears they were hostile to the European settlers from the
beginning; plundering their sitios, waylaying their canoes, and
massacring all who fell into their power. About fifty years ago,
the Portuguese succeeded in turning the warlike propensities of the
Munduruc&uacute;s against them and these, in the course of many
years&rsquo; persecution, greatly weakened the power of the tribe,
and drove a great part of them from their seats on the banks of the
Madeira. The M&uacute;ras are now scattered in single hordes and
families over a wide extent of country bordering the main river
from Villa Nova to Catu&aacute;, near Ega, a distance of 800 miles.
Since the disorders of 1835-6, when they committed great havoc
amongst the peaceable settlements from Santarem to the Rio Negro,
and were pursued and slaughtered in great numbers by the
Munduruc&uacute;s in alliance with the Brazilians, they have given
no serious trouble.</p>

<p>There is one curious custom of the M&uacute;ras which requires
noticing before concluding this digression; this is the practice of
snuff-taking with peculiar ceremonies. The snuff is called
Paric&aacute;, and is a highly stimulating powder made from the
seeds of a species of Inga, belonging to the Leguminous order of
plants. The seeds are dried in the sun, pounded in wooden mortars,
and kept in bamboo tubes. When they are ripe, and the snuff-making
season sets in, they have a fuddling-bout, lasting many days, which
the Brazilians call a <i>Quarentena</i>, and which forms a kind of
festival of a semi-religious character. They begin by drinking
large quantities of cays&uacute;ma and cashir&iacute;, fermented
drinks made of various fruits and mandioca, but they prefer
casha&ccedil;a, or rum, when they can get it. In a short time they
drink themselves into a soddened semi-intoxicated state, and then
commence taking the Paric&aacute;. For this purpose they pair off,
and each of the partners, taking a reed containing a quantity of
the snuff, after going through a deal of unintelligible mummery,
blows the contents with all his force into the nostrils of his
companion. The effect on the usually dull and taciturn savages is
wonderful; they become exceedingly talkative, sing, shout, and leap
about in the wildest excitement. A reaction soon follows; more
drinking is then necessary to rouse them from their stupor, and
thus they carry on for many days in succession. The Mauh&eacute;s
also use the Paric&aacute;, although it is not known amongst their
neighbours the Munduruc&uacute;s. Their manner of taking it is very
different from that of the swinish M&uacute;ras, it being kept in
the form of a paste, and employed chiefly as a preventive against
ague in the months between the dry and wet seasons, when the
disease prevails. When a dose is required, a small quantity of the
paste is dried and pulverised on a flat shell, and the powder then
drawn up into both nostrils at once through two vulture quills
secured together by cotton thread. The use of Paric&aacute; was
found by the early travellers amongst the Omaguas, a section of the
Tup&iacute;s who formerly lived on the Upper Amazons, a thousand
miles distant from the homes of the Mauh&eacute;s and M&uacute;ras.
This community of habits is one of those facts which support the
view of the common origin and near relationship of the Amazonian
Indians.</p>

<p>After leaving Matari, we continued our voyage along the northern
shore. The banks of the river were of moderate elevation during
several days&rsquo; journey; the terra firma lying far in the
interior, and the coast being either lowland or masked with islands
of alluvial formation. On the 14th we passed the upper mouth of the
Parana-mirim de Eva, an arm of the river of small breadth, formed
by a straggling island some ten miles in length, lying parallel to
the northern bank. On passing the western end of this, the main
land again appeared; a rather high rocky coast, clothed with a
magnificent forest of rounded outline, which continues hence for
twenty miles to the mouth of the Rio Negro, and forms the eastern
shore of that river. Many houses of settlers, built at a
considerable elevation on the wooded heights, now enlivened the
riverbanks. One of the first objects which greeted us here was a
beautiful bird we had not hitherto met with, namely, the scarlet
and black tanager (Ramphoccelus nigrogularis), flocks of which were
seen sporting about the trees on the edge of the water, their
flame-coloured liveries lighting up the masses of dark-green
foliage.</p>

<p>The weather, from the 14th to the i8th, was wretched; it rained
sometimes for twelve hours in succession, not heavily, but in a
steady drizzle, such as we are familiar with in our English
climate. We landed at several places on the coast, Penna to trade
as usual, and I to ramble in the forest in search of birds and
insects. In one spot the wooded slope enclosed a very picturesque
scene: a brook, flowing through a ravine in the high bank, fell in
many little cascades to the broad river beneath, its margins decked
out with an infinite variety of beautiful plants. Wild bananas
arched over the watercourse, and the trunks of the trees in its
vicinity were clothed with ferns, large-leaved species belonging to
the genus Lygodium, which, like Osmunda, have their spore-cases
collected together on contracted leaves. On the 18th, we arrived at
a large fazenda (plantation and cattle farm), called Jatuarana. A
rocky point here projects into the stream, and as we found it
impossible to stem the strong current which whirled around it, we
crossed over to the southern shore. Canoes, in approaching the Rio
Negro, generally prefer the southern side on account of the
slackness of the current near the banks. Our progress, however, was
most tediously slow, for the regular east wind had now entirely
ceased, and the vento de cima or wind from up river, having taken
its place, blew daily for a few hours dead against us. The weather
was oppressively close, and every afternoon a squall arose, which,
however, as it came from the right quarter and blew for an hour or
two, was very welcome. We made acquaintance on this coast with a
new insect pest, the Pi&uacute;m, a minute fly, two thirds of a
line in length, which here commences its reign, and continues
henceforward as a terrible scourge along the upper river, or
Solimoens, to the end of the navigation on the Amazons. It comes
forth only by day, relieving the mosquito at sunrise with the
greatest punctuality, and occurs only near the muddy shores of the
stream, not one ever being found in the shade of the forest. In
places where it is abundant, it accompanies canoes in such dense
swarms as to resemble thin clouds of smoke. It made its appearance
in this way the first day after we crossed the river. Before I was
aware of the presence of flies, I felt a slight itching on my neck,
wrist, and ankles, and, on looking for the cause, saw a number of
tiny objects having a disgusting resemblance to lice, adhering to
the skin. This was my introduction to the much-talked-of
Pi&uacute;m. On close examination, they are seen to be minute
two-winged insects, with dark-coloured body and pale legs and
wings, the latter closed lengthwise over the back. They alight
imperceptibly, and squatting close, fall at once to work;
stretching forward their long front legs, which are in constant
motion and seem to act as feelers, and then applying their short,
broad snouts to the skin. Their abdomens soon become distended and
red with blood, and then, their thirst satisfied, they slowly move
off, sometimes so stupefied with their potations that they can
scarcely fly. No pain is felt whilst they are at work, but they
each leave a small circular raised spot on the skin and a
disagreeable irritation. The latter may be avoided in great measure
by pressing out the blood which remains in the spot; but this is a
troublesome task when one has several hundred punctures in the
course of a day. I took the trouble to dissect specimens to
ascertain the way in which the little pests operate. The mouth
consists of a pair of thick fleshy lips, and two triangular horny
lancets, answering to the upper lip and tongue of other insects.
This is applied closely to the skin, a puncture is made with the
lancets, and the blood then sucked through between these into the
oesophagus, the circular spot which results coinciding with the
shape of the lips. In the course of a few days the red spots dry
up, and the skin in time becomes blackened with the endless number
of discoloured punctures that are crowded together. The irritation
they produce is more acutely felt by some persons than others. I
once travelled with a middle-aged Portuguese, who was laid up for
three weeks from the attacks of Pi&uacute;m; his legs being swelled
to an enormous size, and the punctures aggravated into spreading
sores.</p>

<p>A brisk wind from the east sprang tip early in the morning of
the 22nd: we then hoisted all sail, and made for the mouth of the
Rio Negro. This noble stream at its junction with the Amazons,
seems, from its position, to be a direct continuation of the main
river, whilst the Solimoens which joins at an angle and is somewhat
narrower than its tributary, appears to be a branch instead of the
main trunk of the vast water system. One sees therefore at once,
how the early explorers came to give a separate name to this upper
part of the Amazons. The Brazilians have lately taken to applying
the convenient term Alto Amazonas (High or Upper Amazons) to the
Solimoens, and it is probable that this will gradually prevail over
the old name. The Rio Negro broadens considerably from its mouth
upwards, and presents the appearance of a great lake; its
black-dyed waters having no current, and seeming to be dammed up by
the impetuous flow of the yellow, turbid Solimoens, which here
belches forth a continuous line of uprooted trees and patches of
grass, and forms a striking contrast with its tributary. In
crossing, we passed the line, a little more than halfway over,
where the waters of the two rivers meet and are sharply demarcated
from each other. On reaching the opposite shore, we found a
remarkable change. All our insect pests had disappeared, as if by
magic, even from the hold of the canoe; the turmoil of an agitated,
swiftly flowing river, and its torn, perpendicular, earthy banks,
had given place to tranquil water and a coast indented with snug
little bays fringed with sloping, sandy beaches. The low shore and
vivid light-green, endlessly-varied foliage, which prevailed on the
south side of the Amazons, were exchanged for a hilly country,
clothed with a sombre, rounded, and monotonous forest. Our tedious
voyage now approached its termination; a light wind carried us
gently along the coast to the city of Barra, which lies about seven
or eight miles within the mouth of the river. We stopped for an
hour in a clean little bay, to bathe and dress, before showing
ourselves again amongst civilised people. The bottom was visible at
a depth of six feet, the white sand taking a brownish tinge from
the stained but clear water. In the evening I went ashore, and was
kindly received by Senhor Henriques Antony, a warm-hearted Italian,
established here in a high position as merchant, who was the
never-failing friend of stray travellers. He placed a couple of
rooms at my disposal, and in a few hours I was comfortably settled
in my new quarters, sixty-four days after leaving Obydos.</p>

<br>
<p>The town of Barra is built on a tract of elevated, but very
uneven land, on the left bank of the Rio Negro, and contained, in
1850, about 3000 inhabitants. There was originally a small fort
here, erected by the Portuguese, to protect their slave-hunting
expeditions amongst the numerous tribes of Indians which peopled
the banks of the river. The most distinguished and warlike of these
were the Man&aacute;os, who were continually at war with the
neighbouring tribes, and had the custom of enslaving the prisoners
made during their predatory expeditions. The Portuguese disguised
their slave-dealing motives under the pretext of ransoming
(<i>resgatando</i>) these captives; indeed, the term <i>
resgatar</i> (to ransom) is still applied by the traders on the
Upper Amazons to the very general, but illegal, practice of
purchasing Indian children of the wild tribes. The older
inhabitants of the place remember the time when many hundreds of
these captives were brought down by a single expedition. In 1809,
Barra became the chief town of the Rio Negro district; many
Portuguese and Brazilians from other provinces then settled here;
spacious houses were built, and it grew, in the course of thirty or
forty years, to be, next to Santarem, the principal settlement on
the banks of the Amazons. At the time of my visit it was on the
decline, in consequence of the growing distrust, or increased
cunning, of the Indians, who once formed a numerous and the sole
labouring class, but having got to know that the laws protected
them against forced servitude, were rapidly withdrawing themselves
from the place. When the new province of the Amazons was
established, in 1852, Barra was chosen as the capital, and was then
invested with the appropriate name of the city of
Man&aacute;os.</p>

<p>The situation of the town has many advantages; the climate is
healthy; there are no insect pests; the soil is fertile and capable
of growing all kinds of tropical produce (the coffee of the Rio
Negro, especially, being of very superior quality), and it is near
the fork of two great navigable rivers. The imagination becomes
excited when one reflects on the possible future of this place,
situated near the centre of the equatorial part of South America,
in the midst of a region almost as large as Europe, every inch of
whose soil is of the most exuberant fertility, and having water
communication on one side with the Atlantic, and on the other with
the Spanish republics of Venezuela, New Granada, Ecuador, Peru, and
Bolivia. Barra is now the principal station for the lines of
steamers which were established in 1853, and passengers and goods
are transhipped here for the Solimoens and Peru. A steamer runs
once a fortnight between Par&aacute; and Barra, and a bi-monthly
one plies between this place and Nauta in the Peruvian territory.
The steam-boat company is supported by a large annual grant, about
&pound;50,000 sterling, from the imperial government. Barra was
formerly a pleasant place of residence, but it is now in a most
wretched plight, suffering from a chronic scarcity of the most
necessary articles of food. The attention of the settlers was
formerly devoted almost entirely to the collection of the
spontaneous produce of the forests and rivers; agriculture was
consequently neglected, and now the neighbourhood does not produce
even mandioca-meal sufficient for its own consumption. Many of the
most necessary articles of food, besides all luxuries, come from
Portugal, England, and North America. A few bullocks are brought
now and then from Obydos, 500 miles off, the nearest place where
cattle are reared in any numbers, and these furnish at long
intervals a supply of fresh beef, but this is generally monopolised
by the families of government officials. Fowls, eggs, fresh fish,
turtles, vegetables, and fruit were excessively scarce and dear in
1859, when I again visited the place; for instance, six or seven
shillings were asked for a poor lean fowl, and eggs were
twopence-halfpenny a piece. In fact, the neighbourhood produces
scarcely anything; the provincial government is supplied with the
greater part of its funds from the treasury of Par&aacute;; its
revenue, which amounts to about fifty contos of reis (&pound;5600),
derived from export taxes on the produce of the entire province,
not sufficing for more than about one-fifth of its expenditure. The
population of the province of the Amazons, according to a census
taken in 1858, is 55,000 souls; the municipal district of Barra,
which comprises a large area around the capital, containing only
4500 inhabitants. For the government, however, of this small number
of people, an immense staff of officials is gathered together in
the capital, and, notwithstanding the endless number of trivial
formalities which Brazilians employ in every small detail of
administration, these have nothing to do the greater part of their
time. None of the people who flocked to Barra on the establishment
of the new government seemed to care about the cultivation of the
soil and the raising of food, although these would have been most
profitable speculations. The class of Portuguese who emigrate to
Brazil seem to prefer petty trading to the honourable pursuit of
agriculture. If the English are a nation of shopkeepers, what are
we to say of the Portuguese? I counted in Barra one store for every
five dwelling-houses. These stores, or <i>tavernas</i>, have often
not more than fifty pounds&rsquo; worth of goods for their whole
stock, and the Portuguese owners, big lusty fellows, stand all day
behind their dirty counters for the sake of selling a few
coppers&rsquo; worth of liquors, or small wares. These men all give
the same excuse for not applying themselves to agriculture, namely,
that no hands can be obtained to work on the soil. Nothing can be
done with Indians; indeed, they are fast leaving the neighbourhood
altogether, and the importation of negro slaves, in the present
praiseworthy temper of the Brazilian mind, is out of the question.
The problem, how to obtain a labouring class for a new and tropical
country, without slavery, has to be solved before this glorious
region can become what its delightful climate and exuberant
fertility fit it for&mdash;the abode of a numerous, civilised, and happy
people.</p>

<br>
<p>I found at Barra my companion, Mr. Wallace, who, since our joint
Tocantins expedition, had been exploring, partly with his brother,
lately arrived from England, the northeastern coast of
Maraj&oacute;, the river Capim (a branch of the Guam&aacute;, near
Par&aacute;), Monte Alegre, and Santarem. He had passed us by night
below Serpa, on his way to Barra, and so had arrived about three
weeks before me. Besides ourselves, there were half-a-dozen other
foreigners here congregated,&mdash;Englishmen, Germans, and Americans;
one of them a Natural History collector, the rest traders on the
rivers. In the pleasant society of these, and of the family of
Senhor Henriques, we passed a delightful time; the miseries of our
long river voyages were soon forgotten, and in two or three weeks
we began to talk of further explorations. Meantime we had almost
daily rambles in the neighbouring forest. The whole surface of the
land down to the water&rsquo;s edge is covered by the uniform
dark-green rolling forest, the <i>ca&aacute;-apoam</i> (convex
woods) of the Indians, characteristic of the Rio Negro. This
clothes also the extensive areas of lowland, which are flooded by
the river in the rainy season. The olive-brown tinge of the water
seems to be derived from the saturation in it of the dark green
foliage during these annual inundations. The great contrast in form
and colour between the forest of the Rio Negro and those of the
Amazons arises from the predominance in each of different families
of plants. On the main river, palms of twenty or thirty different
species form a great proportion of the mass of trees, whilst on the
Rio Negro, they play a very subordinate part. The characteristic
kind in the latter region is the Jar&aacute; (Leopoldinia pulchra),
a species not found on the margins of the Amazons, which has a
scanty head of fronds with narrow leaflets of the same dark green
hue as the rest of the forest. The stem is smooth, and about two
inches in diameter; its height is not more than twelve to fifteen
feet; it does not, therefore, rise amongst the masses of foliage of
the exogenous trees, so as to form a feature in the landscape, like
the broad-leaved Murumur&uacute; and Urucur&iacute;, the slender
Assa&iacute;, the tall Jauar&iacute;, and the fan-leaved
Murit&iacute; of the banks of the Amazons. On the shores of the
main river the mass of the forest is composed, besides palms, of
Leguminos&aelig;, or trees of the bean family, in endless variety
as to height, shape of foliage, flowers, and fruit; of silk-cotton
trees, colossal nut-trees (Lecythide&aelig;), and Cecropi&aelig;;
the underwood and water-frontage consisting in great part of
broad-leaved Musace&aelig;, Marantace&aelig;, and succulent
grasses: all of which are of light shades of green. The forests of
the Rio Negro are almost destitute of these large-leaved plants and
grasses, which give so rich an appearance to the vegetation
wherever they grow; the margins of the stream being clothed with
bushes or low trees, having the same gloomy monotonous aspect as
the mangroves of the shores of creeks near the Atlantic. The
uniformly small but elegantly-leaved exogenous trees, which
constitute the mass of the forest, consist in great part of members
of the Laurel, Myrtle, Bignoniaceous, and Rubiaceous orders. The
soil is generally a stiff loam, whose chief component part is the
Tabatinga clay, which also forms low cliffs on the coast in some
places, where it overlies strata of coarse sandstone. This kind of
soil and the same geological formation prevail, as we have seen, in
many places on the banks of the Amazons, so that the great contrast
in the forest-clothing of the two rivers cannot arise from this
cause.</p>

<p>The forest was very pleasant for rambling. In some directions
broad pathways led down gentle slopes, through what one might fancy
were interminable shrubberies of evergreens, to moist hollows where
springs of water bubbled up, or shallow brooks ran over their beds
of clean white sand. But the most beautiful road was one that ran
through the heart of the forest to a waterfall, which the citizens
of Barra consider as the chief natural curiosity of their
neighbourhood. The waters of one of the larger rivulets which
traverse the gloomy wilderness, here fall over a ledge of rock
about ten feet high. It is not the cascade itself, but the
noiseless solitude, and the marvellous diversity and richness of
trees, foliage, and flowers encircling the water basin that form
the attraction of the place. Families make picnic excursions to
this spot; and the gentlemen&mdash;it is said the ladies also&mdash;spend the
sultry hours of midday bathing in the cold and bracing waters. The
place is classic ground to the Naturalist from having been a
favourite spot with the celebrated travellers Spix and Martius,
during their stay at Barra in 1820. Von Martins was so much
impressed by its magical beauty that he commemorated the visit by
making a sketch of the scenery serve as background in one of the
plates of his great work on the palms.</p>

<p>Birds and insects, however, were scarce amidst these charming
sylvan scenes. I have often traversed the whole distance from Barra
to the waterfall, about two miles by the forest road, without
seeing or hearing a bird, or meeting with so many as a score of
Lepidopterous and Coleopterous insects. In the thinner woods near
the borders of the forest many pretty little blue and green
creepers of the Dacnid&aelig; group, were daily seen feeding on
berries; and a few very handsome birds occurred in the forest. But
the latter were so rare that we could obtain them only by employing
a native hunter, who used to spend a whole day, and go a great
distance to obtain two or three specimens. In this way I obtained,
amongst others, specimens of the Trogon pavoninus (the
Suruqu&aacute; grande of the natives), a most beautiful creature,
having soft golden green plumage, red breast, and an
orange-coloured beak; also the Ampelis Pompadoura, a rich
glossy-purple chatterer with wings of a snowy-white hue.</p>

<p>After we had rested some weeks in Barra, we arranged our plans
for further explorations in the interior of the country. Mr.
Wallace chose the Rio Negro for his next trip, and I agreed to take
the Solimoens. My colleague has already given to the world an
account of his journey on the Rio Negro, and his adventurous ascent
of its great tributary the Uap&eacute;s. I left Barra for Ega, the
first town of any importance on the Solimoens, on the 26th of
March, 1850. The distance is nearly 400 miles, which we
accomplished in a small cuberta, manned by ten stout Cucama
Indians, in thirty-five days. On this occasion, I spent twelve
months in the upper region of the Amazons; circumstances then
compelled me to return to Par&aacute;. I revisited the same country
in 1855, and devoted three years and a half to a fuller exploration
of its natural productions. The results of both journeys will be
given together in subsequent chapters of this work; in the
meantime, I will proceed to give an account of Santarem and the
river Tapajos, whose neighbourhoods I investigated in the years
1851-4.</p>

<br>
<p>A few words on my visit to Par&aacute; in 1851 may be here
introduced. I descended the river from Ega, to the capital, a
distance of 1400 miles, in a heavily-laden schooner belonging to a
trader of the former place. The voyage occupied no less than
twenty-nine days, although we were favoured by the powerful
currents of the rainy season. The hold of the vessel was filled
with turtle oil contained in large jars, the cabin was crammed with
Brazil nuts, and a great pile of sarsaparilla, covered with a
thatch of palm leaves, occupied the middle of the deck. We had,
therefore, (the master and two passengers) but rough accommodation,
having to sleep on deck, exposed to the wet and stormy weather,
under little toldos or arched shelters, arranged with mats of woven
lianas and maranta leaves. I awoke many a morning with clothes and
bedding soaked through with the rain. With the exception, however,
of a slight cold at the commencement, I never enjoyed better health
than during this journey. When the wind blew from up river or off
the land, we sped away at a great rate; but it was often squally
from those quarters, and then it was not safe to hoist the sails.
The weather was generally calm, a motionless mass of leaden clouds
covering the sky, and the broad expanse of waters flowing smoothly
down with no other motion than the ripple of the current. When the
wind came from below, we tacked down the stream; sometimes it blew
very strong, and then the schooner, having the wind abeam, laboured
through the waves, shipping often heavy seas which washed
everything that was loose from one side of the deck to the
other.</p>

<p>On arriving at Par&aacute;, I found the once cheerful and
healthy city desolated by two terrible epidemics. The yellow fever,
which visited the place the previous year (1850) for the first time
since the discovery of the country, still lingered after having
carried off nearly 5 per cent of the population. The number of
persons who were attacked, namely, three-fourths of the entire
population, showed how general the onslaught is of an epidemic on
its first appearance in a place. At the heels of this plague came
the smallpox. The yellow fever had fallen most severely on the
whites and mamelucos, the negroes wholly escaping; but the smallpox
attacked more especially the Indians, negroes, and people of mixed
colour, sparing the whites almost entirely, and taking off about a
twentieth part of the population in the course of the four months
of its stay. I heard many strange accounts of the yellow fever. I
believe Par&aacute; was the second port in Brazil attacked by it.
The news of its ravages in Bahia, where the epidemic first
appeared, arrived some few days before the disease broke out. The
government took all the sanitary precautions that could be thought
of; amongst the rest was the singular one of firing cannon at the
street corners, to purify the air. Mr. Norris, the American consul,
told me the first cases of fever occurred near the port and that it
spread rapidly and regularly from house to house, along the streets
which run from the waterside to the suburbs, taking about
twenty-four hours to reach the end. Some persons related that for
several successive evenings before the fever broke out the
atmosphere was thick, and that a body of murky vapour, accompanied
by a strong stench, travelled from street to street. This moving
vapour was called the &ldquo;Ma&icirc; da peste&rdquo; (&ldquo;the
mother or spirit of the plague&rdquo;); and it was useless to
attempt to reason them out of the belief that this was the
forerunner of the pestilence. The progress of the disease was very
rapid. It commenced in April, in the middle of the wet season. In a
few days, thousands of persons lay sick, dying or dead. The state
of the city during the time the fever lasted may be easily
imagined. Towards the end of June it abated, and very few cases
occurred during the dry season from July to December.</p>

<p>As I said before, the yellow fever still lingered in the place
when I arrived from the interior in April. I was in hopes I should
escape it, but was not so fortunate; it seemed to spare no
newcomer. At the time I fell ill, every medical man in the place
was worked to the utmost in attending the victims of the other
epidemic; it was quite useless to think of obtaining their aid, so
I was obliged to be my own doctor, as I had been in many former
smart attacks of fever. I was seized with shivering and vomit at
nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Whilst the people of the house
went down to the town for the medicines I ordered, I wrapped myself
in a blanket and walked sharply to and fro along the veranda,
drinking at intervals a cup of warm tea, made of a bitter herb in
use amongst the natives, called Paj&eacute;mari&oacute;ba, a
leguminous plant growing in all waste places. About an hour
afterwards, I took a good draught of a decoction of elder blossoms
as a sudorific, and soon after fell insensible into my hammock. Mr.
Philipps, an English resident with whom I was then lodging, came
home in the afternoon and found me sound asleep and perspiring
famously. I did not wake until almost midnight, when I felt very
weak and aching in every bone of my body. I then took as a
purgative, a small dose of Epsom salts and manna. In forty-eight
hours the fever left me, and in eight days from the first attack, I
was able to get about my work. Little else happened during my stay,
which need be recorded here. I shipped off all my collections to
England, and received thence a fresh supply of funds. It took me
several weeks to prepare for my second and longest journey into the
interior. My plan now was first to make Santarem headquarters for
some time, and ascend from that place the river Tapajos as far as
practicable. Afterwards I intended to revisit the marvellous
country of the Upper Amazons, and work well its natural history at
various stations I had fixed upon, from Ega to the foot of the
Andes.</p>
