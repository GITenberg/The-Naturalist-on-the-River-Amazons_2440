<br>


<p class="first">I embarked at Liverpool, with Mr. Wallace, in a
small trading vessel, on the 26th of April, 1848; and, after a
swift passage from the Irish Channel to the equator, arrived, on
the 26th of May, off Salinas. This is the pilot-station for vessels
bound to Par&aacute;, the only port of entry to the vast region
watered by the Amazons. It is a small village, formerly a
missionary settlement of the Jesuits, situated a few miles to the
eastward of the Par&aacute; River. Here the ship anchored in the
open sea at a distance of six miles from the shore, the shallowness
of the water far out around the mouth of the great river not
permitting, in safety, a nearer approach; and, the signal was
hoisted for a pilot. It was with deep interest that my companion
and myself, both now about to see and examine the beauties of a
tropical country for the first time, gazed on the land where I, at
least, eventually spent eleven of the best years of my life. To the
eastward the country was not remarkable in appearance, being
slightly undulating, with bare sand-hills and scattered trees; but
to the westward, stretching towards the mouth of the river, we
could see through the captain&rsquo;s glass a long line of forest,
rising apparently out of the water; a densely-packed mass of tall
trees, broken into groups, and finally into single trees, as it
dwindled away in the distance. This was the frontier, in this
direction, of the great primaeval forest characteristic of this
region, which contains so many wonders in its recesses, and clothes
the whole surface of the country for two thousand miles from this
point to the foot of the Andes.</p>

<p>On the following day and night we sailed, with a light wind,
partly aided by the tide, up the Par&aacute; river. Towards evening
we passed Vigia and Colares, two fishing villages, and saw many
native canoes, which seemed like toys beneath the lofty walls of
dark forest. The air was excessively close, the sky overcast, and
sheet lightning played almost incessantly around the
horizon&mdash;an appropriate greeting on the threshold of a country
lying close under the equator! The evening was calm, this being the
season when the winds are not strong, so we glided along in a
noiseless manner, which contrasted pleasantly with the unceasing
turmoil to which we had been lately accustomed on the Atlantic. The
immensity of the river struck us greatly, for although sailing
sometimes at a distance of eight or nine miles from the eastern
bank, the opposite shore was at no time visible. Indeed, the
Par&aacute; river is thirty-six miles in breadth at its mouth; and
at the city of Par&aacute;, nearly seventy miles from the sea, it
is twenty miles wide; but at that point, a series of islands
commences which contracts the riverview in front of the port.</p>

<p>On the morning of the 28th of May, we arrived at our
destination. The appearance of the city at sunrise was pleasing in
the highest degree. It is built on a low tract of land, having only
one small rocky elevation at its southern extremity; it, therefore,
affords no amphitheatral view from the river; but the white
buildings roofed with red tiles, the numerous towers and cupolas of
churches and convents, the crowns of palm-trees reared above the
buildings, all sharply defined against the clear blue sky, give an
appearance of lightness and cheerfulness which is most
exhilarating. The perpetual forest hems the city in on all sides
landwards; and towards the suburbs, picturesque country houses are
seen scattered about, half buried in luxuriant foliage. The port
was full of native canoes and other vessels, large and small; and
the ringing of bells and firing of rockets, announcing the dawn of
some Roman Catholic festival day, showed that the population was
astir at that early hour.</p>

<p>We went ashore in due time, and were kindly received by Mr.
Miller, the consignee of the vessel, who invited us to make his
house our home until we could obtain a suitable residence. On
landing, the hot moist mouldy air, which seemed to strike from the
ground and walls, reminded me of the atmosphere of tropical stoves
at Kew. In the course of the afternoon a heavy shower fell, and in
the evening, the atmosphere having been cooled by the rain, we
walked about a mile out of town to the residence of an American
gentleman to whom our host wished to introduce us.</p>

<p>The impressions received during this first walk can never wholly
fade from my mind. After traversing the few streets of tall,
gloomy, convent-looking buildings near the port, inhabited chiefly
by merchants and shopkeepers, along which idle soldiers, dressed in
shabby uniforms carrying their muskets carelessly over their arms,
priests, negresses with red water-jars on their heads, sad-looking
Indian women carrying their naked children astride on their hips,
and other samples of the motley life of the place, we passed down a
long narrow street leading to the suburbs. Beyond this, our road
lay across a grassy common into a picturesque lane leading to the
virgin forest. The long street was inhabited by the poorer class of
the population. The houses were of one story only, and had an
irregular and mean appearance. The windows were without glass,
having, instead, projecting lattice casements. The street was
unpaved, and inches deep in loose sand. Groups of people were
cooling themselves outside their doors&mdash;people of all shades
in colour of skin, European, Negro and Indian, but chiefly an
uncertain mixture of the three. Amongst them were several handsome
women dressed in a slovenly manner, barefoot or shod in loose
slippers, but wearing richly-decorated earrings, and around their
necks strings of very large gold beads. They had dark expressive
eyes, and remarkably rich heads of hair. It was a mere fancy, but I
thought the mingled squalor, luxuriance and beauty of these women
were pointedly in harmony with the rest of the scene&mdash;so
striking, in the view, was the mixture of natural riches and human
poverty. The houses were mostly in a dilapidated condition, and
signs of indolence and neglect were visible everywhere. The wooden
palings which surrounded the weed-grown gardens were strewn about
and broken; hogs, goats, and ill-fed poultry wandered in and out
through the gaps. But amidst all, and compensating every defect,
rose the overpowering beauty of the vegetation. The massive dark
crowns of shady mangos were seen everywhere amongst the dwellings,
amidst fragrant blossoming orange, lemon, and many other tropical
fruit trees, some in flower, others in fruit, at varying stages of
ripeness. Here and there, shooting above the more dome-like and
sombre trees, were the smooth columnar stems of palms, bearing
aloft their magnificent crowns of finely-cut fronds. Amongst the
latter the slim assai-palm was especially noticeable, growing in
groups of four or five; its smooth, gently-curving stem, twenty to
thirty feet high, terminating in a head of feathery foliage,
inexpressibly light and elegant in outline. On the boughs of the
taller and more ordinary-looking trees sat tufts of curiously-
leaved parasites. Slender, woody lianas hung in festoons from the
branches, or were suspended in the form of cords and ribbons;
whilst luxuriant creeping plants overran alike tree-trunks, roofs
and walls, or toppled over palings in a copious profusion of
foliage. The superb banana (Musa paradisiaca), of which I had
always read as forming one of the charms of tropical vegetation,
grew here with great luxuriance&mdash;its glossy velvety-green
leaves, twelve feet in length, curving over the roofs of verandahs
in the rear of every house. The shape of the leaves, the varying
shades of green which they present when lightly moved by the wind,
and especially the contrast they afford in colour and form to the
more sombre hues and more rounded outline of the other trees, are
quite sufficient to account for the charm of this glorious tree.
Strange forms of vegetation drew our attention at almost every
step. Amongst them were the different kinds of Bromelia, or
pine-apple plants, with their long, rigid, sword-shaped leaves, in
some species jagged or toothed along their edges. Then there was
the bread-fruit tree&mdash;an importation, it is true; but
remarkable from its large, glossy, dark green, strongly digitated
foliage, and its interesting history. Many other trees and plants,
curious in leaf, stem, or manner of growth, grew on the borders of
the thickets along which lay our road; they were all attractive to
newcomers, whose last country ramble of quite recent date was over
the bleak moors of Derbyshire on a sleety morning in April.</p>

<p>As we continued our walk the brief twilight commenced, and the
sounds of multifarious life came from the vegetation around. The
whirring of cicadas; the shrill stridulation of a vast number and
variety of field crickets and grasshoppers, each species sounding
its peculiar note; the plaintive hooting of tree frogs&mdash;all
blended together in one continuous ringing sound&mdash;the audible
expression of the teeming profusion of Nature. As night came on,
many species of frogs and toads in the marshy places joined in the
chorus&mdash;their croaking and drumming, far louder than anything
I had before heard in the same line, being added to the other
noises, created an almost deafening din. This uproar of life, I
afterwards found, never wholly ceased, night or day. In the course
of time I became, like other residents, accustomed to it. It is,
however, one of the peculiarities of a tropical&mdash;at least, a
Brazilian&mdash;climate which is most likely to surprise a
stranger. After my return to England, the deathlike stillness of
summer days in the country appeared to me as strange as the ringing
uproar did on my first arrival at Par&aacute;. The object of our
visit being accomplished, we returned to the city. The fire-flies
were then out in great numbers, flitting about the sombre woods,
and even the frequented streets. We turned into our hammocks, well
pleased with what we had seen, and full of anticipation with regard
to the wealth of natural objects we had come to explore.</p>

<br>
<p>During the first few days, we were employed in landing our
baggage and arranging our extensive apparatus. We then accepted the
invitation of Mr. Miller to make use of his rocinha, or
country-house in the suburbs, until we finally decided on a
residence. Upon this, we made our first essay in housekeeping. We
bought cotton hammocks, the universal substitute for beds in this
country, cooking utensils and crockery, and engaged a free negro,
named Isidoro, as cook and servant-of-all-work. Our first walks
were in the immediate suburbs of Par&aacute;. The city lies on a
corner of land formed by the junction of the river Guam&amp;a with
the Par&aacute;. As I have said before, the forest, which covers
the whole country, extends close up to the city streets; indeed,
the town is built on a tract of cleared land, and is kept free from
the jungle only by the constant care of the Government. The
surface, though everywhere low, is slightly undulating, so that
areas of dry land alternate throughout with areas of swampy ground,
the vegetation and animal tenants of the two being widely
different. Our residence lay on the side of the city nearest the
Guam&aacute;, on the borders of one of the low and swampy areas
which here extends over a portion of the suburbs. The tract of land
is intersected by well-macadamised suburban roads, the chief of
which, the Estrada das Mongubeiras (the Monguba road), about a mile
long, is a magnificent avenue of silk-cotton trees (Bombax monguba
and B. ceiba), huge trees whose trunks taper rapidly from the
ground upwards, and whose flowers before opening look like red
balls studding the branches. This fine road was constructed under
the governorship of the Count dos Arcos, about the year 1812. At
right angles to it run a number of narrow green lanes, and the
whole district is drained by a system of small canals or trenches
through which the tide ebbs and flows, showing the lowness of the
site. Before I left the country, other enterprising presidents had
formed a number of avenues lined with cocoa-nut palms, almond and
other trees, in continuation of the Monguba road, over the more
elevated and drier ground to the north-east of the city. On the
high ground the vegetation has an aspect quite different from that
which it presents in the swampy parts. Indeed, with the exception
of the palm-trees, the suburbs here have an aspect like that of a
village green at home. The soil is sandy, and the open commons are
covered with a short grassy and shrubby vegetation. Beyond this,
the land again descends to a marshy tract, where, at the bottom of
the moist hollows, the public wells are situated. Here all the
linen of the city is washed by hosts of noisy negresses, and here
also the water-carts are filled&mdash;painted hogsheads on wheels,
drawn by bullocks. In early morning, when the sun sometimes shines
through a light mist, and everything is dripping with moisture,
this part of the city is full of life; vociferous negroes and
wrangling Gallegos,<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> the proprietors of
the water-carts, are gathered about, jabbering continually, and
taking their morning drams in dirty wine-shops at the street
corners.</p>

<p>Along these beautiful roads we found much to interest us during
the first few days. Suburbs of towns, and open, sunny cultivated
places in Brazil, are tenanted by species of animals and plants
which are mostly different from those of the dense primaeval
forests. I will, therefore, give an account of what we observed of
the animal world during our explorations in the immediate
neighbourhood of Par&aacute;.</p>

<p>The number and beauty of the birds and insects did not at first
equal our expectations. The majority of the birds we saw were small
and obscurely coloured; they were indeed similar, in general
appearance, to such as are met with in country places in England.
Occasionally a flock of small parroquets, green, with a patch of
yellow on the forehead, would come at early morning to the trees
near the Estrada. They would feed quietly, sometimes chattering in
subdued tones, but setting up a harsh scream, and flying off, on
being disturbed. Humming-birds we did not see at this time,
although I afterwards found them by hundreds when certain trees
were in flower. Vultures we only saw at a distance, sweeping round
at a great height, over the public slaughter-houses. Several
flycatchers, finches, ant-thrushes, a tribe of plainly-coloured
birds, intermediate in structure between flycatchers and thrushes,
some of which startle the new-comer by their extraordinary notes
emitted from their places of concealment in the dense thickets; and
also tanagers, and other small birds, inhabited the neighbourhood.
None of these had a pleasing song, except a little brown wren
(Troglodytes furvus), whose voice and melody resemble those of our
English robin. It is often seen hopping and climbing about the
walls and roofs of houses and on trees in their vicinity. Its song
is more frequently heard in the rainy season, when the Monguba
trees shed their leaves. At those times the Estrada das Mongubeiras
has an appearance quite unusual in a tropical country. The tree is
one of the few in the Amazon region which sheds all its foliage
before any of the new leaf-buds expand. The naked branches, the
sodden ground matted with dead leaves, the grey mist veiling the
surrounding vegetation, and the cool atmosphere soon after sunrise,
all combine to remind one of autumnal mornings in England. Whilst
loitering about at such times in a half-oblivious mood, thinking of
home, the song of this bird would create for the moment a perfect
illusion. Numbers of tanagers frequented the fruit and other trees
in our garden. The two principal kinds which attracted our
attention were the Rhamphocoelus Jacapa and the Tanagra Episcopus.
The females of both are dull in colour, but the male of Jacapa has
a beautiful velvety purple and black plumage, the beak being partly
white, whilst the same sex in Episcopus is of a pale blue colour,
with white spots on the wings. In their habits they both resemble
the common house- sparrow of Europe, which does not exist in South
America, its place being in some measure filled by these familiar
tanagers. They are just as lively, restless, bold, and wary; their
notes are very similar, chirping and inharmonious, and they seem to
be almost as fond of the neighbourhood of man. They do not,
however, build their nests on houses.</p>

<p>Another interesting and common bird was the Japim, a species of
Cassicus (C. icteronotus). It belongs to the same family of birds
as our starling, magpie, and rook&mdash;it has a rich yellow and
black plumage, remarkably compact and velvety in texture. The shape
of its head and its physiognomy are very similar to those of the
magpie; it has light grey eyes, which give it the same knowing
expression. It is social in its habits, and builds its nest, like
the English rook, on trees in the neighbourhood of habitations. But
the nests are quite differently constructed, being shaped like
purses, two feet in length, and suspended from the slender branches
all around the tree, some of them very near the ground. The
entrance is on the side near the bottom of the nest. The bird is a
great favourite with the Brazilians of Par&aacute;&mdash;it is a
noisy, stirring, babbling creature, passing constantly to and fro,
chattering to its comrades, and is very ready at imitating other
birds, especially the domestic poultry of the vicinity. There was
at one time a weekly newspaper published at Par&aacute;, called <i>
The Japim</i>; the name being chosen, I suppose, on account of the
babbling propensities of the bird. Its eggs are nearly round, and
of a bluish-white colour, speckled with brown.</p>

<p>Of other vertebrate animals we saw very little, except of the
lizards. These are sure to attract the attention of the newcomer
from Northern Europe, by reason of their strange appearance, great
numbers, and variety. The species which are seen crawling over the
walls of buildings in the city are different from those found in
the forest or in the interior of houses. They are unpleasant-
looking animals, with colours assimilated to those of the
dilapidated stone and mud walls on which they are seen. The house
lizards belong to a peculiar family, the Geckos, and are found even
in the best-kept chambers, most frequently on the walls and
ceilings, to which they cling motionless by day, being active only
at night. They are of speckled grey or ashy colours. The structure
of their feet is beautifully adapted for clinging to and running
over smooth surfaces; the underside of their toes being expanded
into cushions, beneath which folds of skin form a series of
flexible plates. By means of this apparatus they can walk or run
across a smooth ceiling with their backs downwards; the plated
soles, by quick muscular action, exhausting and admitting air
alternately. The Geckos are very repulsive in appearance. The
Brazilians give them the name of Osgas, and firmly believe them to
be poisonous; they are, however, harmless creatures. Those found in
houses are small; but I have seen others of great size, in crevices
of tree trunks in the forest. Sometimes Geckos are found with
forked tails; this results from the budding of a rudimentary tail
at the side, from an injury done to the member. A slight rap will
cause their tails to snap off; the loss being afterwards partially
repaired by a new growth. The tails of lizards seem to be almost
useless appendages to these animals. I used often to amuse myself
in the suburbs, whilst resting in the verandah of our house during
the heat of mid-day, by watching the variegated green, brown, and
yellow ground-lizards. They would come nimbly forward, and commence
grubbing with their forefeet and snouts around the roots of
herbage, searching for insect larvae. On the slightest alarm, they
would scamper off, their tails cocked up in the air as they waddled
awkwardly away, evidently an incumbrance to them in their
flight.</p>

<p>Next to the birds and lizards, the insects of the suburbs of
Par&aacute; deserve a few remarks. The species observed in the
weedy and open places, as already remarked, were generally
different from those which dwell in the shades of the forest. In
the gardens, numbers of fine showy butterflies were seen. There
were two swallow-tailed species, similar in colours to the English
Papilio Machaon; a white Pieris (P. Monuste), and two or three
species of brimstone and orange coloured butterflies, which do not
belong, however, to the same genus as our English species. In weedy
places a beautiful butterfly, with eye-like spots on its wings was
common, the Junonia Lavinia, the only Amazonian species which is at
all nearly related to our Vanessas, the Admiral and Peacock
Butterflies. One day, we made our first acquaintance with two of
the most beautiful productions of nature in this
department&mdash;namely, the Helicopis Cupido and Endymion. A
little beyond our house, one of the narrow green lanes which I have
already mentioned diverged from the Monguba avenue, and led,
between enclosures overrun with a profusion of creeping plants and
glorious flowers, down to a moist hollow, where there was a public
well in a picturesque nook, buried in a grove of Mucaj&aacute;
palm-trees. On the tree trunks, walls, and palings, grew a great
quantity of climbing Pothos plants, with large glossy heart-shaped
leaves. These plants were the resort of these two exquisite
species, and we captured a great number of specimens. They are of
extremely delicate texture. The wings are cream-coloured, the hind
pair have several tail-like appendages, and are spangled beneath as
if with silver. Their flight is very slow and feeble; they seek the
protected under-surface of the leaves, and in repose close their
wings over the back, so as to expose the brilliantly spotted
under-surface.</p>

<p>I will pass over the many other orders and families of insects,
and proceed at once to the ants. These were in great numbers
everywhere, but I will mention here only two kinds. We were amazed
at seeing ants an inch and a quarter in length, and stout in
proportion, marching in single file through the thickets. These
belonged to the species called Dinoponera grandis. Its colonies
consist of a small number of individuals, and are established about
the roots of slender trees. It is a stinging species, but the sting
is not so severe as in many of the smaller kinds. There was nothing
peculiar or attractive in the habits of this giant amongst the
ants. Another far more interesting species was the Sa&uuml;ba
(&OElig;codoma cephalotes). This ant is seen everywhere about the
suburbs, marching to and fro in broad columns. From its habit of
despoiling the most valuable cultivated trees of their foliage, it
is a great scourge to the Brazilians. In some districts it is so
abundant that agriculture is almost impossible, and everywhere
complaints are heard of the terrible pest.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig1.jpg" width="354" height="238" alt=
"Sa&uuml;ba or Leaf-carrying ant.&mdash;1. Worker-minor; 2. Worker-major; 3. Subterranean worker.">
</center>

<p>The workers of this species are of three orders, and vary in
size from two to seven lines; some idea of them may be obtained
from the accompanying woodcut. The true working-class of a colony
is formed by the small-sized order of workers, the worker-minors as
they are called (Fig. 1). The two other kinds, whose functions, as
we shall see, are not yet properly understood, have enormously
swollen and massive heads; in one (Fig. 2), the head is highly
polished; in the other (Fig. 3), it is opaque and hairy. The
worker-minors vary greatly in size, some being double the bulk of
others. The entire body is of very solid consistency, and of a pale
reddish-brown colour. The thorax or middle segment is armed with
three pairs of sharp spines; the head, also, has a pair of similar
spines proceeding from the cheeks behind.</p>

<p>In our first walks we were puzzled to account for large mounds
of earth, of a different colour from the surrounding soil, which
were thrown up in the plantations and woods. Some of them were very
extensive, being forty yards in circumference, but not more than
two feet in height. We soon ascertained that these were the work of
the Sa&uuml;bas, being the outworks, or domes, which overlie and
protect the entrances to their vast subterranean galleries. On
close examination, I found the earth of which they are composed to
consist of very minute granules, agglomerated without cement, and
forming many rows of little ridges and turrets. The difference in
colour from the superficial soil of the vicinity is owing to their
being formed of the undersoil, brought up from a considerable
depth. It is very rarely that the ants are seen at work on these
mounds; the entrances seem to be generally closed; only now and
then, when some particular work is going on, are the galleries
opened. The entrances are small and numerous; in the larger
hillocks it would require a great amount of excavation to get at
the main galleries; but, I succeeded in removing portions of the
dome in smaller hillocks, and then I found that the minor entrances
converged, at the depth of about two feet, into one broad,
elaborately-worked gallery or mine, which was four or five inches
in diameter.</p>

<p>This habit of the Sa&uuml;ba ant, of clipping and carrying away
immense quantities of leaves, has long been recorded in books on
natural history. When employed on this work, their processions look
like a multitude of animated leaves on the march. In some places I
found an accumulation of such leaves, all circular pieces, about
the size of a sixpence, lying on the pathway, unattended by ants,
and at some distance from any colony. Such heaps are always found
to be removed when the place is revisited the next day. In course
of time I had plenty of opportunities of seeing them at work. They
mount the tree in multitudes, the individuals being all
worker-minors. Each one places itself on the surface of a leaf, and
cuts, with its sharp scissor-like jaws, a nearly semicircular
incision on the upper side; it then takes the edge between its
jaws, and by a sharp jerk detaches the piece. Sometimes they let
the leaf drop to the ground, where a little heap accumulates, until
carried off by another relay of workers; but, generally, each
marches off with the piece it has operated upon, and as all take
the same road to their colony, the path they follow becomes in a
short time smooth and bare, looking like the impression of a
cartwheel through the herbage.</p>

<p>It is a most interesting sight to see the vast host of busy
diminutive labourers occupied on this work. Unfortunately, they
choose cultivated trees for their purpose. This ant is quite
peculiar to Tropical America, as is the entire genus to which it
belongs; it sometimes despoils the young trees of species growing
wild in its native forests, but seems to prefer, when within reach,
plants imported from other countries, such as the coffee and orange
trees. It has not hitherto been shown satisfactorily to what use it
applies the leaves. I discovered this only after much time spent in
investigation. The leaves are used to thatch the domes which cover
the entrances to their subterranean dwellings, thereby protecting
from the deluging rains the young broods in the nests beneath. The
larger mounds, already described, are so extensive that few persons
would attempt to remove them for the purpose of examining their
interior; but smaller hillocks, covering other entrances to the
same system of tunnels and chambers, may be found in sheltered
places, and these are always thatched with leaves, mingled with
granules of earth. The heavily- laden workers, each carrying its
segment of leaf vertically, the lower edge secured in its
mandibles, troop up and cast their burdens on the hillock; another
relay of labourers place the leaves in position, covering them with
a layer of earthy granules, which are brought one by one from the
soil beneath.</p>

<p>The underground abodes of this wonderful ant are known to be
very extensive. The Rev. Hamlet Clark has related that the
Sa&uuml;ba of Rio de Janeiro, a species closely allied to ours, has
excavated a tunnel under the bed of the river Par&aacute;hyba, at a
place where it is broad as the Thames at London Bridge. At the
Magoary Rice Mills, near Par&aacute;, these ants once pierced the
embankment of a large reservoir; the great body of water which it
contained escaped before the damage could be repaired. In the
Botanic Gardens, at Par&aacute;, an enterprising French gardener
tried all he could think of to extirpate the Sa&uuml;ba. With this
object, he made fires over some of the main entrances to their
colonies, and blew the fumes of sulphur down the galleries by means
of bellows. I saw the smoke issue from a great number of outlets,
one of which was seventy yards distant from the place where the
bellows were used. This shows how extensively the underground
galleries are ramified.</p>

<p>Besides injuring and destroying young trees by despoiling them
of their foliage, the Sa&uuml;ba ant is troublesome to the
inhabitants from its habit of plundering the stores of provisions
in houses at night, for it is even more active by night than in the
day-time. At first I was inclined to discredit the stories of their
entering habitations and carrying off grain by grain the farinha or
mandioca meal, the bread of the poorer classes of Brazil. At
length, whilst residing at an Indian village on the Tapajos, I had
ample proof of the fact. One night my servant woke me three or four
hours before sunrise, by calling out that the rats were robbing the
farinha baskets&mdash;the article at that time being scarce and
dear. I got up, listened, and found the noise was very unlike that
made by rats. So, I took the light and went into the store- room,
which was close to my sleeping-place. I there found a broad column
of Sauba ants, consisting of thousands of individuals, as busy as
possible, passing to and fro between the door and my precious
baskets. Most of those passing outwards were laden each with a
grain of farinha, which was, in some cases, larger and many times
heavier than the bodies of the carriers. Farinha consists of grains
of similar size and appearance to the tapioca of our shops; both
are products of the same root, tapioca being the pure starch, and
farinha the starch mixed with woody fibre, the latter ingredient
giving it a yellowish colour. It was amusing to see some of the
dwarfs, the smallest members of their family, staggering along,
completely hidden under their load. The baskets, which were on a
high table, were entirely covered with ants, many hundreds of whom
were employed in snipping the dry leaves which served as lining.
This produced the rustling sound which had at first disturbed us.
My servant told me that they would carry off the whole contents of
the two baskets (about two bushels) in the course of the night, if
they were not driven off; so we tried to exterminate them by
killing them with our wooden clogs. It was impossible, however, to
prevent fresh hosts coming in as fast as we killed their
companions. They returned the next night; and I was then obliged to
lay trains of gunpowder along their line, and blow them up. This,
repeated many times, at last seemed to intimidate them, for we were
free from their visits during the remainder of my residence at the
place. What they did with the hard dry grains of mandioca I was
never able to ascertain, and cannot even conjecture. The meal
contains no gluten, and therefore would be useless as cement. It
contains only a small relative portion of starch, and, when mixed
with water, it separates and falls away like so much earthy matter.
It may serve as food for the subterranean workers. But the young or
larvae of ants are usually fed by juices secreted by the worker
nurses.</p>

<p>Ants, it is scarcely necessary to observe, consist, in each
species, of three sets of individuals, or, as some express it, of
three sexes&mdash;namely, males, females, and workers; the last-
mentioned being undeveloped females. The perfect sexes are winged
on their first attaining the adult state; they alone propagate
their kind, flying away, previous to the act of reproduction, from
the nest in which they have been reared. This winged state of the
perfect males and females, and the habit of flying abroad before
pairing, are very important points in the economy of ants; for they
are thus enabled to intercross with members of distant colonies
which swarm at the same time, and thereby increase the vigour of
the race, a proceeding essential to the prosperity of any species.
In many ants, especially those of tropical climates, the workers,
again, are of two classes, whose structure and functions are widely
different. In some species they are wonderfully unlike each other,
and constitute two well-defined forms of workers. In others, there
is a gradation of individuals between the two extremes. The curious
differences in structure and habits between these two classes form
an interesting, but very difficult, study. It is one of the great
peculiarities of the Sa&uuml;ba ant to possess <i>three</i> classes
of workers. My investigations regarding them were far from
complete; I will relate, however, what I have observed on the
subject.</p>

<p>When engaged in leaf-cutting, plundering farinha, and other
operations, two classes of workers are always seen (<a href=
"images\fig1.jpg">Figs. 1 and 2</a>). They are not, it is true,
very sharply defined in structure, for individuals of intermediate
grades occur. All the work, however, is done by the individuals
which have small heads (Fig. 1), whilst those which have enormously
large heads, the worker-majors (Fig. 2), are observed to be simply
walking about. I could never satisfy myself as to the function of
these worker-majors. They are not the soldiers or defenders of the
working portion of the community, like the armed class in the
termites, or white ants, for they never fight. The species has no
sting, and does not display active resistance when interfered with.
I once imagined they exercised a sort of superintendence over the
others; but this function is entirely unnecessary in a community
where all work with a precision and regularity resembling the
subordinate parts of a piece of machinery. I came to the
conclusion, at last, that they have no very precisely defined
function. They cannot, however, be entirely useless to the
community, for the sustenance of an idle class of such bulky
individuals would be too heavy a charge for the species to sustain.
I think they serve, in some sort, as passive instruments of
protection to the real workers. Their enormously large, hard, and
indestructible heads may be of use in protecting them against the
attacks of insectivorous animals. They would be, on this view, a
kind of &ldquo;pieces de resistance,&rdquo; serving as a foil
against onslaughts made on the main body of workers.</p>

<center><img src="images/fig2.jpg" width="315" height="178" alt=
"Sauba Ant.&mdash;Female."></center>

<p>The third order of workers is the most curious of all. If the
top of a small, fresh hillock, one in which the thatching process
is going on, is taken off, a broad cylindrical shaft is disclosed
at a depth of about two feet from the surface. If this is probed
with a stick, which may be done to the extent of three or four feet
without touching bottom, a small number of colossal fellows (Fig.
3) will slowly begin to make their way up the smooth sides of the
mine. Their heads are of the same size as those of the class Fig.
2, but the front is clothed with hairs, instead of being polished,
and they have in the middle of the forehead a twin, ocellus, or
simple eye, of quite different structure from the ordinary compound
eyes, on the sides of the head. This frontal eye is totally wanting
in the other workers, and is not known in any other kind of ant.
The apparition of these strange creatures from the cavernous depths
of the mine reminded me, when I first observed them, of the
Cyclopes of Homeric fable. They were not very pugnacious, as I
feared they would be, and I had no difficulty in securing a few
with my fingers. I never saw them under any other circumstances
than those here related, and what their special functions may be I
cannot divine.</p>

<p>The whole arrangement of a Formicarium, or ant-colony, and all
the varied activity of ant-life, are directed to one main
purpose&mdash;the perpetuation and dissemination of the species.
Most of the labour which we see performed by the workers has for
its end the sustenance and welfare of the young brood, which are
helpless grubs. The true females are incapable of attending to the
wants of their offspring; and it is on the poor sterile workers,
who are denied all the other pleasures of maternity, that the
entire care devolves. The workers are also the chief agents in
carrying out the different migrations of the colonies, which are of
vast importance to the dispersal and consequent prosperity of the
species. The successful <i>d&eacute;</i> but of the winged males
and females depends likewise on the workers. It is amusing to see
the activity and excitement which reigns in an ant&rsquo;s nest
when the exodus of the winged individuals is taking place. The
workers clear the roads of exit, and show the most lively interest
in their departure, although it is highly improbable that any of
them will return to the same colony. The swarming or exodus of the
winged males and females of the Sa&uuml;ba ant takes place in
January and February, that is, at the commencement of the rainy
season. They come out in the evening in vast numbers, causing quite
a commotion in the streets and lanes. They are of very large size,
the female measuring no less than two-and-a-quarter inches in
expanse of wing; the male is not much more than half this size.
They are so eagerly preyed upon by insectivorous animals that on
the morning after their flight not an individual is to be seen, a
few impregnated females alone escaping the slaughter to found new
colonies.</p>

<br>
<p>At the time of our arrival, Par&aacute; had not quite recovered
from the effects of a series of revolutions, brought about by the
hatred which existed between the native Brazilians and the
Portuguese; the former, in the end, calling to their aid the Indian
and mixed coloured population. The number of inhabitants of the
city had decreased, in consequence of these disorders, from 24,500
in 1819, to 15,000 in 1848. Although the public peace had not been
broken for twelve years before the date of our visit, confidence
was not yet completely restored, and the Portuguese merchants and
tradesmen would not trust themselves to live at their beautiful
country-houses or rocinhas, which lie embosomed in the luxuriant
shady gardens around the city. No progress had been made in
clearing the second-growth forest which had grown over the once
cultivated grounds, and now reached the end of all the suburban
streets. The place had the aspect of one which had seen better
days; the public buildings, including the palaces of the President
and Bishop, the cathedral, the principal churches and convents, all
seemed constructed on a scale of grandeur far beyond the present
requirements of the city. Streets full of extensive private
residences, built in the Italian style of architecture, were in a
neglected condition, weeds and flourishing young trees growing from
large cracks in the masonry. The large public squares were
overgrown with weeds and impassable, on account of the swampy
places which occupied portions of their areas. Commerce, however,
was now beginning to revive, and before I left the country I saw
great improvements, as I shall have to relate towards the
conclusion of this narrative.</p>

<p>The province of which Par&aacute; is the capital, was at the
time I allude to, the most extensive in the Brazilian empire, being
about 1560 miles in length from east to west, and about 600 in
breadth. Since that date&mdash;namely in 1853&mdash;it has been
divided into two by the separation of the Upper Amazons as a
distinct province. It formerly constituted a section, capitania, or
governorship of the Portuguese colony. Originally it was well
peopled by Indians, varying much in social condition according to
their tribe, but all exhibiting the same general physical
characters, which are those of the American red man, somewhat
modified by long residence in an equatorial forest country. Most of
the tribes are now extinct or forgotten, at least those which
originally peopled the banks of the main river, their descendants
having amalgamated with the white and negro immigrants:<sup><a
href="#2">2</a></sup> many still exist, however, in their original
state on the Upper Amazons and most of the branch rivers. On this
account, Indians in this province are far more numerous than
elsewhere in Brazil, and the Indian element may be said to prevail
in the mongrel population&mdash;the negro proportion being much
smaller than in South Brazil.</p>

<p>The city is built on the best available site for a port of entry
to the Amazons region, and must in time become a vast emporium; the
northern shore of the main river, where alone a rival capital could
be founded, is much more difficult of access to vessels, and is
besides extremely unhealthy. Although lying so near the equator
(1&deg; 28' S. lat.) the climate is not excessively hot. The
temperature during three years only once reached 95&deg;
Fahrenheit. The greatest heat of the day, about 2 p.m., ranges
generally between 89&deg; and 94&deg;; but on the other hand, the
air is never cooler than 73&deg;, so that a uniformly high
temperature exists, and the mean of the year is 81&deg;. North
American residents say that the heat is not so oppressive as it is
in summer in New York and Philadelphia. The humidity is, of course,
excessive, but the rains are not so heavy and continuous in the wet
season as in many other tropical climates. The country had for a
long time a reputation for extreme salubrity. Since the small-pox
in 1819, which attacked chiefly the Indians, no serious epidemic
had visited the province. We were agreeably surprised to find no
danger from exposure to the night air or residence in the low
swampy lands. A few English residents, who had been established
here for twenty or thirty years, looked almost as fresh in colour
as if they had never left their native country. The native women,
too, seemed to preserve their good looks and plump condition until
late in life. I nowhere observed that early decay of appearance in
Brazilian ladies, which is said to be so general in the women of
North America. Up to 1848 the salubrity of Par&aacute; was quite
remarkable for a city lying in the delta of a great river, in the
middle of the tropics and half surrounded by swamps. It did not
much longer enjoy its immunity from epidemics. In 1850 the yellow
fever visited the province for the first time, and carried off in a
few weeks more than four per cent of the population. One disease
after another succeeded, until in 1855 cholera swept through the
country and caused fearful havoc. Since then, the healthfulness of
the climate has been gradually restored, and it is now fast
recovering its former good reputation. Par&aacute; is free from
serious endemic disorders, and was once a resort of invalids from
New York and Massachusetts. The equable temperature, the perpetual
verdure, the coolness of the dry season when the sun&rsquo;s heat
is tempered by the strong sea- breezes and the moderation of the
periodical rains, make the climate one of the most enjoyable on the
face of the earth.</p>

<p>The province is governed, like all others in the empire, by a
President, as chief civil authority. At the time of our arrival he
also held, exceptionally, the chief military command. This
functionary, together with the head of the police administration
and the judges, is nominated by the central Government at Rio
Janeiro. The municipal and internal affairs are managed by a
provincial assembly elected by the people. Every villa or borough
throughout the province also possesses its municipal council, and
in thinly-populated districts the inhabitants choose every four
years a justice of the peace, who adjudicates in small disputes
between neighbours. A system of popular education exists, and every
village has its school of first letters, the master being paid by
the government, the salary amounting to about &pound;70, or the
same sum as the priests receive. Besides common schools, a
well-endowed classical seminary is maintained at Par&aacute;, to
which the sons of most of the planters and traders in the interior
are sent to complete their education. The province returns its
quota of members every four years to the lower and upper houses of
the imperial parliament. Every householder has a vote. Trial by
jury has been established, the jurymen being selected from
householders, no matter what their race or colour; and I have seen
the white merchant, the negro husbandman, the mameluco, the
mulatto, and the Indian, all sitting side by side on the same
bench. Altogether the constitution of government in Brazil seems to
combine happily the principles of local self-government and
centralisation, and only requires a proper degree of virtue and
intelligence in the people to lead the nation to great
prosperity.</p>

<p>The province of Par&aacute;, or, as we may now say, the two
provinces of Par&aacute; and the Amazons, contain an area of
800,000 square miles, the population of which is only about
230,000, or in the ratio of one person to four square miles! The
country is covered with forests, and the soil is fertile in the
extreme, even for a tropical country. It is intersected throughout
by broad and deep navigable rivers. It is the pride of the
Par&aacute;enses to call the Amazons the Mediterranean of South
America. The colossal stream perhaps deserves the name, for not
only have the main river and its principal tributaries an immense
expanse of water bathing the shores of extensive and varied
regions, but there is also throughout a system of back channels,
connected with the main rivers by narrow outlets and linking
together a series of lakes, some of which are fifteen, twenty, and
thirty miles in length. The whole Amazons valley is thus covered by
a network of navigable waters, forming a vast inland freshwater sea
with endless ramifications&mdash;rather than a river.</p>

<p>The city of Par&aacute; was founded in 1615, and was a place of
considerable importance towards the latter half of the eighteenth
century, under the government of the brother of Pombal, the famous
Portuguese statesman. The province was the last in Brazil to
declare its independence of the mother-country and acknowledge the
authority of the first emperor, Don Pedro. This was owing to the
great numbers and influence of the Portuguese, and the rage of the
native party was so great in consequence, that immediately after
independence was proclaimed in 1823, a counter revolution broke
out, during which many hundred lives were lost and much hatred
engendered. The antagonism continued for many years, partial
insurrections taking place when the populace thought that the
immigrants from Portugal were favoured by the governors sent from
the capital of the empire. At length, in 1835, a serious revolt
took place which in a short time involved the entire province. It
began by the assassination of the President and the leading members
of the government; the struggle was severe, and the native party in
an evil hour called to their aid the ignorant and fanatic part of
the mongrel and Indian population. The cry of death to the
Portuguese was soon changed to death to the freemasons, then a
powerfully organised society embracing the greater part of the male
white inhabitants. The victorious native party endeavoured to
establish a government of their own. After this state of things had
endured six months, they accepted a new President sent from Rio
Janeiro, who, however, again irritated them by imprisoning their
favourite leader, Vinagre. The revenge which followed was
frightful. A vast host of half- savage coloured people assembled in
the retired creeks behind Par&aacute;, and on a day fixed, after
Vinagre&rsquo;s brother had sent a message three times to the
President demanding, in vain, the release of their leader, the
whole body poured into the city through the gloomy pathways of the
forest which encircles it. A cruel battle, lasting nine days, was
fought in the streets; an English, French, and Portuguese
man-of-war, from the side of the river, assisting the legal
authorities. All the latter, however, together with every friend of
peace and order, were finally obliged to retire to an island a few
miles distant. The city and province were given up to anarchy; the
coloured people, elated with victory, proclaimed the slaughter of
all whites, except the English, French, and American residents. The
mistaken principals who had first aroused all this hatred of races
were obliged now to make their escape. In the interior, the
supporters of lawful authority including, it must be stated, whole
tribes of friendly Indians and numbers of the better disposed
negroes and mulattos, concentrated themselves in certain strong
positions and defended themselves, until the reconquest of the
capital and large towns of the interior in 1836 by a force sent
from Rio Janeiro&mdash;after ten months of anarchy.</p>

<p>Years of conciliatory government, the lesson learned by the
native party and the moderation of the Portuguese, aided by the
indolence and passive goodness of the Par&aacute;enses of all
classes and colours, were only beginning to produce their good
effects about the time I am speaking of. Life, however, was now and
had been for some time quite safe throughout the country. Some few
of the worst characters had been transported or imprisoned, and the
remainder, after being pardoned, were converted once more into
quiet and peaceable citizens.</p>

<p>I resided at Par&aacute; nearly a year and a half altogether,
returning thither and making a stay of a few months after each of
my shorter excursions into the interior, until the 6th of November,
1851, when I started on my long voyage to the Tapajos and the Upper
Amazons, which occupied me seven years and a half. I became during
this time tolerably familiar with the capital of the Amazons
region, and its inhabitants. Compared with other Brazilian seaport
towns, I was always told, Par&aacute; shone to great advantage. It
was cleaner, the suburbs were fresher, more rural and much
pleasanter on account of their verdure, shade, and magnificent
vegetation. The people were simpler, more peaceable and friendly in
their manners and dispositions; and assassinations, which give the
southern provinces so ill a reputation, were almost unknown. At the
same time the Par&aacute; people were much inferior to Southern
Brazilians in energy and industry. Provisions and house rents being
cheap and the wants of the people few&mdash;for they were content
with food and lodging of a quality which would be spurned by
paupers in England&mdash;they spent the greater part of their time
in sensual indulgences and in amusements which the government and
wealthier citizens provided for them gratis. The trade, wholesale
and retail, was in the hands of the Portuguese, of whom there were
about 2500 in the place. Many handicrafts were exercised by
coloured people, mulattos, mamelucos, free negroes, and Indians.
The better sort of Brazilians dislike the petty details of
shop-keeping, and if they cannot be wholesale merchants, prefer the
life of planters in the country, however small may be the estate
and the gains. The negroes constituted the class of field-labourers
and porters; Indians were universally the watermen, and formed the
crews of the numberless canoes of all sizes and shapes which traded
between Par&aacute; and the interior. The educated Brazilians, not
many of whom are of pure Caucasian descent&mdash;for the
immigration of Portuguese, for many years, has been almost
exclusively of the male sex&mdash;are courteous, lively, and
intelligent people. They were gradually weaning themselves of the
ignorant, bigoted notions which they inherited from their
Portuguese ancestors, especially those entertained with regard to
the treatment of women. Formerly, the Portuguese would not allow
their wives to go into society, or their daughters to learn reading
and writing. In 1848, Brazilian ladies were only just beginning to
emerge from this inferior position, and Brazilian fathers were
opening their eyes to the advantages of education for their
daughters. Reforms of this kind are slow. It is, perhaps, in part
owing to the degrading position always held by women, that the
relations between the sexes were, and are still, on so
unsatisfactory a footing, and private morality at so low an ebb, in
Brazil. In Par&aacute;, I believe that an improvement is now taking
place, but formerly promiscuous intercourse seemed to be the
general rule amongst all classes, and intrigues and love-making the
serious business of the greater part of the population. That this
state of things is a necessity depending on the climate and
institutions I do not believe, as I have resided at small towns in
the interior, where the habits, and the general standard of
morality of the inhabitants, were as pure as they are in similar
places in England.</p>
