description: "The Naturalist on the River Amazons, subtitled A Record of the Adventures,\
  \ Habits of Animals, Sketches of Brazilian and Indian Life, and Aspects of Nature\
  \ under the Equator, during Eleven Years of Travel, is an 1863 book by the British\
  \ naturalist Henry Walter Bates about his expedition to the Amazon basin. Bates\
  \ and his friend Alfred Russel Wallace set out to obtain new species and new evidence\
  \ for evolution by natural selection, as well as exotic specimens to sell. He explored\
  \ thousands of miles of the Amazon and its tributaries, and collected over 14,000\
  \ species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration\
  \ of butterflies led him to discover Batesian mimicry.\nThe book contains an evenly\
  \ distributed mixture of natural history, travel, and observation of human societies,\
  \ including the towns with their Catholic processions. Only the most remarkable\
  \ discoveries of animals and plants are described, and theories such as evolution\
  \ and mimicry are barely mentioned. Bates remarks that finding a new species is\
  \ only the start; he also describes animal behaviour, sometimes in detail, as for\
  \ the army ants. He constantly relates the wildlife to the people, explaining how\
  \ the people hunt, what they eat and what they use as medicines. The book is illustrated\
  \ with drawings by leading artists including E. W. Robinson, Josiah Wood Whymper,\
  \ Joseph Wolf and Johann Baptist Zwecker.\nOn Bates's return to England, he was\
  \ encouraged by Charles Darwin to write up his eleven-year stay in the Amazon as\
  \ a book. The result was widely admired, not least by Darwin; other reviewers sometimes\
  \ disagreed with the book's support for evolution, but generally enjoyed his account\
  \ of the journey, scenery, people, and natural history. The book has been reprinted\
  \ many times, mostly in Bates's own effective abridgement for the second edition,\
  \ which omitted the more technical descriptions.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
